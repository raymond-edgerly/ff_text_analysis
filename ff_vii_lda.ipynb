      "Barret: That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught... They probably don't realize that we've sneaked in yet. We should get to the reactor in no time. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!\n",
      "Barret: Good, so far everything's going as planned. Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor. Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.\n",
      "Barret: Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!\n",

      "Barret: Hey, you oughta know this building well.\n",
      "Barret: I heard about this place before. Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees. Must be where they took Aeris. The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!\n",
      "Barret: Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......\n",
      "Barret: Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, Aeris'll...\n",

      "Barret: Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time...\n",
      "Barret: F...finally... M...made it... N...never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life...\n",
      "Barret: Hey Cloud! You come all this way, you thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?\n",
      "Barret: We ain't got no time for that! Stop messin' around, boy!\n",
      "Barret: Yeah, that's right! Let's go on then!\n",
      "Barret: This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.\n",

      "Barret: I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists. Is that right?\n",
      "Barret: The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy. Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy. ...and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.\n",
      "Barret: I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin'new members!! Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aeris too. How 'bout you?\n",

      "Barret: Rufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!\n",
      "Barret: Vice President Rufus. The President's son.\n",
      "Barret: I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long time...\n",
      "Barret: I'm from AVALANCHE!\n",
      "Barret: You only President, 'cause yer old man died!\n",
      "Barret: What?\n",
      "Barret: The hell's that supposed to mean?\n",
      "Barret: Awright, Cloud!\n",
      "Barret: I'll go on ahead!\n",
      "Barret: *&^%(*... surrounded, huh? If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but, I gotta reputation to protect.\n",
      "Barret: Yeah, well that ain't happenin'. You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to watch out for you!\n",
      "Barret: Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses...\n",
      "Barret: Who you callin' Mr. Barret? That don't sound right!\n",
      "Barret: Huh? Oh, oh yeah... You a cold man. Just like someone else 'round here I know.\n",
      "Barret: Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?\n",
      "Barret: Tifa! Where's Cloud?\n",
      "Barret: Huh? What's up? Where's Cloud?\n",
      "Barret: Well, what do we do now?\n",
      "Barret: And that'll save the Planet?\n",
      "Barret: Awright, I'm going!\n",
      "Barret: We told Aeris's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe too.\n",
      "Barret: We need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could be the leader.\n",
      "Barret: ^#$^%......awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there.\n",
      "Barret: 'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. It's too dangerous. Split us into 2 parties...\n",
      "Barret: ...Thought you'd do that.\n",
      "Barret: Later, at Kalm!\n",
      "Barret: Hey Cloud. If we keep going, we'll never get to Kalm.\n",
      "Barret: Yo, wassup? Can't SOLDIER-man even lead the way?\n",
      "Barret: This is Kalm.\n",
      "Barret: Yo, I'll be waitin' at the inn... Hurry up and get your butt over there!\n",
      "Barret: Get over here!\n",
      "Barret: Yo man, you're late!\n",
      "Barret: So let's hear your story...... You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet. Let's hear it all.\n",
      "Barret: You call that a friend?\n",
      "Barret (over narration): You wait a minute!! Isn't that, um...? The name of Sephiroth's mother...\n",
      "Barret: I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.\n",
      "Barret: Tifa, I was only......\n",
      "Barret (over narration): Now you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!\n",
      "Barret (over narration): Yo wait, I wanna hear.\n",
      "Barret (over narration): Tell us more! You saw your family, right?\n",
      "Barret: Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!\n",
      "Barret: (Why you talkin' to me!?)\n",
      "Barret: Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?\n",
      "Barret: Damn! Don't none of this make sense! I'm going, going, going, gone! And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!\n",
      "Barret: Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!\n",
      "Barret: Yo, Cloud. Here.\n",
      "Barret: Awright then, we're outta here.\n",
      "Barret: This Sephiroth guy's pretty strong, I'd say.\n",
      "Barret: Wh, who are you!?\n",
      "Barret: No! You got it all wrong! We're fighting against the Shinra!\n",
      "Barret: Hey! Look at that!\n",
      "Barret: C'mon Cloud.\n",
      "Barret: I'm gonna relax for a while.\n",
      "Barret: Seems like something's goin' on up there!\n",
      "Barret: What's that music? It sure sounds lively.\n",
      "Barret: Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects.\n",
      "Barret: We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the tower?\n",
      "Barret: Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of Shinra, Inc.!\n",
      "Barret: Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump like that!\n",
      "Barret: Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you!\n",
      "Barret: Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet.\n",
      "Barret: Look, Cloud. It's Rufus and Heidegger. They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em...\n",
      "Barret: Ummmm...... Gmmmmm...... How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that? Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge...... Jessie......! Ggggggggh... Ggggh......! Ggggggghhh!!\n",
      "Barret: God!! I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna settle things here and now......\n",
      "Barret: Damn, did they find us!?\n",
      "Barret: Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean...Tifa and the others!?\n",
      "Barret: Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!\n",
      "Barret: You all right!?\n",
      "Barret: Hey, wait. You don't think that suspicious character is... Sephiroth!?\n",
      "Barret: How the hell am I supposed to know!?\n",
      "Barret: I'm goin' too!\n",
      "Barret: Look, Cloud!!\n",
      "Barret: Isn't he......that guy?\n",
      "Barret: Jenova...You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?\n",
      "Barret: He said the time is now.\n",
      "Barret: I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on! Cloud, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?\n",
      "Barret: Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.\n",
      "Barret: Damn! Sure is hot here! But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.\n",
      "Barret: Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!\n",
      "Barret: ......What'ya mean \"cute\"?\n",
      "Barret: I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?\n",
      "Barret: Uh uh!\n",
      "Barret: Hmmm!?\n",
      "Barret: Marlene! You ok?......\n",
      "Barret: Dad'll wear this when I go to see you.\n",
      "Barret: Uh uh!\n",
      "Barret: Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, awright!?\n",
      "Barret: Yo, yo! It's a bad idea to kill him.\n",
      "Barret's Past[]\n",
      "Barret: ............ahh.\n",
      "Barret: ......whew!\n",
      "Barret: Haaeyy!\n",
      "Barret: Haeey!! Baaeby!!\n",
      "Barret: Haeey!! Baaeby!!\n",
      "Barret: ...I'm sorry...\n",
      "Barret: You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was...destroyed...\n",
      "Barret: Sorry.\n",
      "Barret: My hometown used to be around here.\n",
      "Barret: It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years.\n",
      "Barret: An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.\n",
      "Barret (narrating): ...My hometown, Corel's always been a coal mining town. It's so dusty, but calm and so poor...... A real small town, this one. That's the first time I ever heard the word \"Mako Reactor\" mentioned since that time...\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times.\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.\n",
      "Barret (narrating): That's how the Corel Reactor was built......and completed. We all thought it would bring us an easier life.\n",
      "Barret (narrating): It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days. Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops. All the townspeople... All my relatives...... Everyone...everything......\n",
      "Barret: There was an explosion at a reactor. Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.\n",
      "Barret: Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself. Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor...\n",
      "Barret: That's why... that's why I get so pissed off!! Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too...\n",
      "Barret: It's all my fault...\n",
      "Barret: ......I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes' leave me alone.\n",
      "Barret: So PLAY! ...messin' round #@^%$! Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!\n",
      "Barret: Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with. Jes' leave me alone...\n",
      "Barret: Didn't I tell you not to come here!?\n",
      "Barret: Didn't want none of ya to get involved...\n",
      "Barret: You guys...\n",
      "Barret: There's another... another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms. It was four years ago...\n",
      "Barret (narrating): I remember... I was on my way home from visiting a Mako Reactor being built.\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): What!!!?\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): What the hell happened?......\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): Hmp!! Old man!!\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): Krggh!!\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): Shu' up!!\n",
      "Barret (in flashback): Dyne!! Hang on!! Lissen to me!! You're comin' back to the village, hear!!?\n",
      "Barret: From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more. ...I was depressed for a while. But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in. Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away...\n",
      "Barret: Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me. But, his was the left arm.\n",
      "Barret: ...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace. An' that's why, I gotta go alone.\n",
      "Barret: Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now.\n",
      "Barret: ...Dyne ...Is that you?\n",
      "Barret: I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday... I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation.\n",
      "Barret: Listen to me Dyne. I want to...\n",
      "Barret: ......?\n",
      "Barret: ...I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me. But...What're you doin' in a place like this? Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?\n",
      "Barret: .......\n",
      "Barret: Dyne,Marlene...... Marlene's still alive.\n",
      "Barret: I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure. That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end. That's when I found her... ...found Marlene.\n",
      "Barret: She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?\n",
      "Barret: What!?\n",
      "Barret: Dyne...are you insane!?\n",
      "Barret: Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!\n",
      "Barret: Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!\n",
      "Barret: Cloud, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!\n",
      "Barret: Dyne...I don't know either, man. Is this the only way... we can resolve this?\n",
      "Barret: An' what 'bout Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?\n",
      "Barret: ......\n",
      "Barret: All right...\n",
      "Barret: Dyne...?\n",
      "Barret: Dyne!\n",
      "Barret: Dy------ne!!\n",
      "Barret: ...Dyne. Me an' you were the same... My hands ain't any cleaner...... I shouldn't be able to carry...Marlene either...\n",
      "Barret: Uuuurrrrrrgh!!!\n",
      "Barret: I want to go up.\n",
      "Barret: Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak. So, I got this, instead.\n",
      "Barret: I want to go up.\n",
      "Barret: The hell do YOU know!!\n",
      "Barret: Say what!?\n",
      "Barret: Awright then. Cloud, you go. We'll wait down here. Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!\n",
      "Barret: I don't like it. How'd they find out where we were?\n",
      "Barret: A spy, maybe? No, no way.\n",
      "Barret: I finally made it... So this is...Cosmo Canyon!\n",
      "Barret: Good timin'. Let's take a breather. I got stuff I want to find out, too.\n",
      "Barret: This is really somethin'!\n",
      "Barret: Whoa! Shootin' stars!Barret: This's really somethin'!\n",
      "Barret: Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born... I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate... Biggs... Wedge... Jessie... Now they're all gone... died for the planet.Barret: ...Really? To save the planet? We all... we all hate the Shinra... Do I even got a to go on? Will they...... ...will they ever forgive me?Barret: ...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing. If there's anything I can do, to save the planet...or the people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it! I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care......let 'em decide for 'emselves.Barret: Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!! Again... Again...AVALANCHE's born again!\n",
      "Barret: ...Where're they going?\n",
      "Barret: That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times...\n",
      "Barret: The hell's goin' on!? This a dream or somethin'?\n",
      "Barret: You said the whole town burnt down, right?\n",
      "Barret: You trin' to fool us!?\n",
      "Barret: The Shinra always keep the most useful things to themselves. Let's steal it!\n",
      "Barret: I'm Barret, of AVALANCHE.\n",
      "Barret: ...damn, man. Wassup with that guy's attitude?\n",
      "Barret: He always like this? That's pretty bad!\n",
      "Barret: It won't stop!\n",
      "Barret: I don't care.\n",
      "Barret: What!? The hell happened, all of a sudden!?\n",
      "Barret: ...Hah, I know what you're thinkin'. And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?\n",
      "Barret: ...You serious? And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!? That means, I don't trust you.\n",

      "Barret: Is it some sort of a disaster? It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.\n",

      "Barret: I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.\n",
      "Barret: But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.\n",
      "Barret: Just a damn jackass, that's what you are...\n",
      "Barret: Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time. He has to decide this on his own. You believe in Cloud... right?\n",
      "Barret: Hey, how are you? I just wanna know, which is it gonna be? You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out? Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is worry about it. Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it happens, it happens. I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to normal!\n",
      "Barret: If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.\n",
      "Barret: Hey yo! Wait up.Barret: That way goes to the Mountains up north. Let's hurry and find Aeris.\n",
      "Barret: heh, there's a bed.\n",

      "Barret: Of course.\n",
      "Barret: Hey, what's that!? They just gave you something, right? Let's use the  button to find out.\n",
      "Barret: You know, I've been thinkin'...?\n",
      "Barret: Y'know...standing here like this... Kinda makes you feel like the Planet's not on our side, don't it? Of course we can't even compete. I mean... The Planet don't even notice us humans...\n",
      "Barret: So all this energy's gathered here for the planet to heal itself?\n",
      "Barret: The rest is up to you!\n",
      "Barret: He got away?\n",
      "Barret: Sephiroth...... What a damn crazy #*&^%.\n",

      "Barret: Why Nibelheim!? Are you high on Mako or something?\n",
      "Barret: That ain't Cloud... The hell is he?\n",
      "Barret: How the hell're we gonna get outta here?\n",
      "Barret: This is bad... Just like Corel.\n",
      "Barret: Hey, you awright!?Barret: Damn! This was an illusion.\n",

      "Barret: Yo! Cloud! Stop! Knock it off!\n",
      "Barret: Huh?\n",
      "Barret: You'll be better soon. You've been asleep for a long time.\n",
      "Barret: Hey, why don't you ask?\n",
      "Barret: About him.\n",
      "Barret: Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either.\n",
      "Barret: Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry... None of them know if he's all right either.\n",
      "Barret: Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days.\n",
      "Barret: You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave? Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of light. Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by the barrier. We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.\n",
      "Barret: An' on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a rampage.\n",
      "Barret: Remember that huge monster that was with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater? Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past.\n",
      "Barret: Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up. Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got guts.\n",
      "Barret: We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no time...\n",
      "Barret: ...Dunno.\n",
      "Barret: Execution!? What're ya gonna get by executin' us?\n",
      "Barret: I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!\n",
      "Barret: The hell are these people?\n",
      "Barret: If you've gotta do it...do me first!\n",
      "Barret: Huh!? Sleeping gas?\n",
      "Barret: Why you......? Ain't you part of Shinra?\n",
      "Barret: It won't open!\n",
      "Barret: Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!\n",
      "Barret: Shi-!\n",
      "Barret: The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!\n",
      "Barret: Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!\n",
      "Barret: No! They locked this too!\n",
      "Barret: Goddammit......!!\n",
      "Barret: Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?\n",
      "Barret: Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!\n",
      "Barret: You damn cat......! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon!\n",
      "Barret: Yo, better watch my back till the end...partner!\n",
      "Barret: You okay?\n",
      "Barret: Dammit! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship!?\n",
      "Barret: I thought...... Tifa was gone for good.\n",
      "Barret: What's that sad face for?\n",
      "Barret: Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this! No way we can get offa this train we're on!\n",
      "Barret: Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!\n",
      "Barret: What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?...... We did fine without him in the beginning...... Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to?\n",
      "Barret: Whenever I think of Cloud, everything gets all jumbled up. No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans. But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us...... Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do......\n",
      "Barret: You sure!?\n",
      "Barret: Uh......!? Yo, Tifa!!\n",
      "Barret: That's bad......\n",
      "Barret: So what about him? You know......Cloud?\n",
      "Barret: No wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here......\n",
      "Barret: .......hope......Barret: Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back? What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow......Doctor: Is something wrong?Barret: No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc.\n",
      "Barret: You okay?\n",
      "Barret: Yeah, that's probably best...... For Cloud...... an' for you......\n",
      "Barret: Why you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.\n",
      "Barret: You take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud.\n",
      "Barret: We gotta get back to the Highwind.\n",
      "Barret: What're we gonna do now! What can WE do?\n",
      "Barret: Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do? An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better.\n",
      "Barret: Yeah, what!? That you a spy?\n",
      "Barret: Corel! What else can they do to Corel!?\n",
      "Barret: Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!\n",
      "Barret: Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked.\n",
      "Barret: I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just...shut your face!\n",
      "Barret: Every group's gotta have a leader. An' that's me! Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader. I never knew that till lately.\n",
      "Barret: An' that's what is......\n",
      "Barret: You been chosen to be the new leader.\n",
      "Barret: But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you. We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You! That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can.\n",
      "Barret: Awright, now here's the first job. The Operation Room's waiting for you!\n",
      "Barret: Yo, Cid! When you're ready, we're headin' for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr.leader, you'd better hurry.\n",
      "Barret\n",
      "Barret: Damn man, it's Huge Materia.\n",
      "Barret: We gotta get there first and beat'em no matter what!\n",
      "Barret: You mus' mean Cloud......\n",
      "Barret: He's still alive.\n",
      "Barret: Oh man...... You look like hell.\n",
      "Barret: Oh man, this is real bad.\n",
      "Barret: We gotta get there first and protect it!!\n",
      "Barret: Cloud, it's you......\n",
      "Barret: Da---mn!\n",
      "Barret: NO! You damn boneheads!\n",
      "Barret: How can they even drive this?\n",
      "Barret: What!?\n",
      "Barret: Got no time for that now!\n",
      "Barret: Hey, it's not working!\n",
      "Barret: Hey...HEY HEY!!\n",
      "Barret: We'll get there first!\n",
      "Barret: Cloud...\n",
      "Barret: I did it again... I can't keep up with this.\n",
      "Barret: We'll get there before 'em!\n",
      "Barret: Cloud...\n",
      "Barret: Can't keep regrettin' the past... It's the future we gotta think about now.\n",
      "Barret: We'll get there first!\n",
      "Barret: Cloud...\n",
      "Barret: Yo, wanna see what Tifa and the gang are doing?\n",
      "Barret: Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I woudda smashed him......\n",
      "Barret: Looks like the Lifestream's settled down now too.\n",
      "Barret: Yo! You awright!? Tifa!?\n",
      "Barret: Don't worry about him. He's a tough one.\n",
      "Barret: Awright, I know... I shouldn't have doubted him. But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady.\n",
      "Barret: Yo, Tifa! Snap outta it!!\n",
      "Barret: Tifa......!?\n",
      "Barret: Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say.\n",
      "Barret: That means there ain't no difference from before!\n",
      "Barret: Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet!?\n",
      "Barret: Oh, uh, you mean that!\n",
      "Barret: There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!\n",
      "Barret: C'mon, Cloud! Don't #&$* around! We're goin' to Junon, boyeee!!\n",
      "Barret: Damn, just missed it!\n",
      "Barret: We're gonna help transport the Huge Materia...Reno!\n",
      "Barret: Damn! So they was just buyin' time!?\n",
      "Barret: We ain't jes' gonna let them take the Huge Materia, are we?\n",
      "Barret: Come on, Cloud! Follow me!\n",
      "Barret: Damn, man!! ......what the...? Hey yo! Remember I was the leader first, man!\n",
      "Barret: Yo! We come a long ways since we got on that train! Lotsa things changed! This and that.\n",
      "Barret: Stop your blubberin'!! How we gonna move this without you?\n",
      "Barret: Arrrrrrrgh!!Barret: EY!! Looks likes we're almost on our way! Just keep on fiddlin' with it!! It's all up to you!\n",
      "Barret: Don't worry! If it breaks down, I'll smack it one--that'll fix it!\n",
      "Barret: Is it us?\n",
      "Barret: Shit! What's all this 'Climbing!' crap? Gimme a break!\n",
      "Barret: Whatcha gonna do!?\n",
      "Barret: Yo!! Junon airport?\n",
      "Barret: Yeah! I could go for that! Let's go to the submarine dock under Junon!\n",
      "Barret: Let's go after it!\n",
      "Barret: But where to?\n",
      "Barret: Them Shinra guys think they're gonna fight Meteor with the Huge Materia?\n",
      "Barret: Can't we do somethin'? We can't jus' leave it.\n",
      "Barret: Hey wait a second! What's gonna happen to the Huge Materia?\n",
      "Barret: ...damn! ...can't lift it!\n",
      "Barret: What a bust... But I kinda hoped it'd work.\n",
      "Barret: You're pretty damn optimistic ! You up to somethin'?\n",
      "Barret: Yo! Cid! You even got to me!\n",
      "Barret: Do, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor?\n",
      "Barret: That Bugenhagen guy... He was a weird old dude. I thought he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them machines.\n",
      "Barret: This ain't no good with just us! Cloud, we gotta get some others in here.\n",
      "Barret: Me too...\n",
      "Barret: We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean.\n",
      "Barret: And Aeris...she's dead. Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the planet, huh? But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again...\n",
      "Barret: Whacha gonna do, Cloud? Got any good ideas?\n",
      "Barret: That's 'WE'!\n",
      "Barret: The thing Aeris left for us... We gotta take care of it.\n",
      "Barret: Hey! What's gonna happen to Marlene!?\n",
      "Barret: ...that was for the life of the planet. Ya gotta expect a few casualties.\n",
      "Barret: I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra...\n",
      "Barret: That damn Weapon... He's one big *&$*&%$... Even Midgar's gonna be in trouble.\n",
      "Barret: Wassup, Mr. Monster? What're you lookin' at?\n",
      "Barret: Let's go back to the Highwind!\n",
      "Barret: Marlene!!\n",
      "Barret: Damn...\n",
      "Barret: When AVALANCHE was jes startin', we used to put up flyers everywhere. And now, we're up against Sephiroth. How about that? Feels like a long time ago.\n",
      "Barret: Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?\n",
      "Barret: YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!\n",
      "Barret: You're busted, Reeve! Too late tryin' to hide it now...\n",
      "Barret: You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?\n",
      "Barret: An explosion!!\n",
      "Barret: Damn...!\n",
      "Barret: Comin' and goin'... gettin' pushed around. But I got a debt to all them back in Midgar that I can't never repay...\n",
      "Barret: Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law! There'll be no way we could slip into the slums.\n",
      "Barret: Huh? Where are we...?\n",
      "Barret: Sounds strange comin' from me... But it feels like home bein' back in Midgar. Kinda makes me sick...\n",
      "Barret: Leave this to me! Hurry to the cannon!\n",
      "Barret: What the... hell is that!!?\n",
      "Barret: Hey! This is ...\n",
      "Barret: This is great. Hold on, Hojo......!\n",
      "Barret: Anyway...that's the end of the cannon...\n",
      "Barret: Don't ask me that.\n",
      "Barret: Don't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight!\n",
      "Barret: You're right... It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet. But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor...... Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to do things. I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer...\n",
      "Barret: ...At first, it was revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my town. But now...... Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene. For Marlene... For Marlene's future... Yeah...I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake...\n",
      "Barret: O, oh......is that okay with you?\n",
      "Barret: Well lookey-here. The Shinra Manager's come back.\n",
      "Barret: I guess that's everyone.\n",
      "Barret: We didn't come back for your spikey headed ass! We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my......whatcha call, feelings or somethin'. I, uh I ain't got no words now......\n",
      "Barret: Heh heh......heh heh heh... Time's got a way of sneakin' up on ya, huh? I'm shakin' all over... Heh heh...I feel sick...\n",
      "Barret: All right. Then I'll go...\n",
      "Barret: Well...... Looks like this is our last big job!\n",
      "Barret: Cloud which way you gonna choose?\n",
      "Barret: All right, I'm goin'...\n",
      "Barret: Ain't no way I'm gonna die until I stick this into that guy.\n",
      "Barret: Yo, we're a bit late?\n",
      "Barret\n",
      "Barret: Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?\n",
      "Barret: What?\n",
      "Barret: Cloud! You go first!\n",
      "Barret: Shu'up! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here!\n",
      "Barret: Cloud! Hurry up and make up your mind!\n",
      "Barret: What's that!?\n",
      "Barret: Ugh...! Is this......the true power of Sephiroth?\n",
      "Barret: Urrrrrgh!!Barret: Not only Aeris... Holy is the prayer of AVALANCHE... Of Marlene and Dyne...... And everyone on the planet!\n",
      "Barret: Wait! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?\n",
      "Barret: Heeeey!\n",
      "Barret: They all seem to be safe, too.\n",
      "Barret: But...now what're we going to do?\n",
      "Barret: Wait a damn minute! What's going to happen to Midgar? We can't let that happen!\n",
      "Barret: What the hell IS that ...... ?\n",
      "Barret: Yo, Cloud! Over here, now!\n",
      "Barret: Don't want no money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals. We jes want back what your boss stole from us. I mean, \"who\" he stole from us.\n",
      "Barret: Now we ain't gonna hurt you. Might even pay ya, if ya help us.\n",
      "Barret: Wassup with that broad?\n",
      "Barret: Hey, we been had! And... my money!\n",
      "Barret: Shit!! Gimme back my money!!\n",
      "Barret: Gone... Wassup with that?\n",
      "Barret: Ey, let's get some rest.\n",
      "Barret: Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?\n",
      "Barret: The hell you talkin' about!? They're all fightin' the Shinra too! You gonna ignore that!?\n",
      "Barret: Huh? Something's up there?\n",
      "Barret: Damn, that's one big bird! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?\n",
      "Barret: I'll do it! I'll protect them from Shinra!\n",
      "Barret: What's there to think about? We gotta do it!\n",
      "Barret: Hey! We'll come to the rescue.\n",
      "Barret: What are you thinking!? And you call yourself a human!?\n",
