<p><b><i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a></i> script</b> comprises the full text transcript of the original <a href="/wiki/PlayStation" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> release of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>.
</p>
<dl><dt>Notes</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Script content is split into <a href="/wiki/Category:Chapters_in_Final_Fantasy_VII" title="Category:Chapters in Final Fantasy VII">chapters</a> translated from the <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Ultimania_Omega" title="Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega">Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega</a></i>.</li>
<li>The name of the speaker will be used next to all dialogue even if the text box in-game does not list the character's name.
<ul><li>Player characters that can join the party can be renamed. The script assumes their default name (unless a different name is given, as "Red" is listed in one of Red XIII's lines before he joins), including before the player can name them, but notes when they can be named.</li>
<li>For non-player characters that are unnamed, and have no name next to their text box, "NPC" is used.</li></ul></li>
<li>Some in-game dialogue is not included in their respective chapter if they are not unique or specifically tied to said chapter. These lines will be placed together in a single section in the <a href="#Miscellaneous">&#167; Miscellaneous</a> section.
<ul><li>Optional dialogue is listed next to event triggers, but grouped by before/after Meteor is summoned (start of Act 3, "Turmoil"), due to the drastic change in dialogue thereafter. If optional dialogue only occurs during a specific chapter, it is grouped under the chapter in which it can be seen.</li>
<li>Dialogue is ordered by the earliest possible place it can be triggered.</li></ul></li>
<li>Yuffie and Vincent are both optional characters. Their dialogue is included in the script, but will not appear if the player does not recruit them.</li>
<li>Some dialogue by other party members depends on the order in which they are listed in the player's party, with the party leader exempted as they can be placed on any slot. For instance, if the party leader is on slot 1, the "first party member" will be the one on slot 2; if the party leader is on slot 2, then "first party member" refers to the one on slot 1.</li></ul>

<p>(Upon talking to the person standing.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>NPC</b>: Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see...Don't be fooled by Shinra!  Mako energy doesn't last forever! Mako is the planet's lifesource! The end is in sight! Protectors of the planet: AVALANCHE</li></ul>
<p>(Upon being spotted by soldiers.)<br />
<b>Soldier</b>: Hey! You there!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Shinra Soldiers......<br />
</p>
<ul><li>(After defeating the first set of soldiers in a battle upon selecting "Fight them!".)<br /><b>Soldier</b>: What the?<br /><b>Cloud</b>: hmph!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Later!" and avoiding battle.)<br /><b>Soldier</b>: Halt!!</li></ul>
<ul><li>(After defeating the second set of soldiers in a battle upon selecting "Fight them!".)<br /><b>Soldier</b>: That's him!!<br /><b>Cloud</b>: hmph!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Later!" and avoiding the second set of soldiers, no dialogue.)</li></ul>

<p>(After a fourth set of soldiers arrive, regardless of previous options.)<br />
<b>Soldier</b>: That's as far as you go.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys.
</p><p><b>Soldier</b>: Enough babbling...... Grab him!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What a pain......
</p><p>(After Cloud jumps to the train to Sector 8.)<br />
<b>Wedge</b>: Cloud never came.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Cloud...... Wonder if he was killed?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: No way!!
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Cloud......
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Say, do you think Cloud's...... Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE!?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: The hell would I know!? Do I look like a mind reader? Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups...
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Hey, Barret! What about our money...? Uh, nothin'...sorry. Ahhh......
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Cloud!!
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Cloud!!
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Cloud......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Looks like I'm a little late.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You damn right, you're late!! Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's no big deal. Just what I always do.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Shi't! Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hmm...... You were worried about me!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Wha!? I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Wake up! We're movin' out! Follow me!
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Hey, Cloud!! You were great back there!
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Heh heh......Cloud! We'll do even better next time.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Be careful, I'll shut this.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Oh, Cloud!! Your face is pitch-black......
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: There you go!
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Say, thanks for helping me back there at the Reactor!
</p><p>(Upon entering next car.)<br />
<b>On-screen</b>: Last train out of Sector 8 Station. Last stop is Sector 7, Train Graveyard. Expected time of arrival is 12:23AM, Midgar Standard Time...
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man sleeping on the right.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Huh...? This is my house, so make yourselves at home.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man sitting on the left.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: You see the headlines in the Shinra Times? The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums. ...blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this one. They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Biggs.)<br />
<b>Biggs</b>: It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet. I'm sure that will change by tomorrow.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Biggs a second time.)<br />
<b>Biggs</b>: ...YAWN...that sure took its toll on me. I'm gonna sleep till we get to the station.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Wedge.)<br />
<b>Wedge</b>: Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous ...and me, too!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Wedge a second time.)<br />
<b>Wedge</b>: Cloud!! Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "What do you have in mind?".)<br /><b>Wedge</b>: All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick. But, after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "I wouldn't hold my breath".)<br /><b>Wedge</b>: Oh man, that's pretty harsh, Cloud. You really think I won't?</li></ul>
<p>(Upon attempting to go to the next car.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>NPC</b>: Please!! You're bothering the other passengers.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Jessie.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me? It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors...you know, flashy stuff.
</p><p>(While viewing Midgar Rail System map.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: Okay, it's about to start.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: This is a complete model of the city of Midgar. It's about a 1/10000 scale. The top plate is about 50 meters above ground. A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section... psst...whisper...whisper... (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.) Then there's No.2, No.3 all the way up to the No.8 Reactor. The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity. Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them. Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Phew..., this is next! Look.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: This is the route this train is on. The route spirals around the main support structure. We should be coming around the center area, right now. At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up. It can check the identities and background on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters. whisper...whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)
</p><p>(After view has closed.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: Speak of the devil... That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area. ...whisper...whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.) ...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Biggs.)<br />
<b>Biggs</b>: ...snore...heebeebeeheebee...snore... (Don't act so damn big, Barret...snooze...)
</p><p>(Upon talking to Wedge.)<br />
<b>Wedge</b>: I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Jessie.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: I know! Next time, I'll give you one I made myself. 
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selection "Thanks anyway".)<br /><b>Jessie</b>: Oh yeah, you might regret it. I'm the type who takes things personal.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Looking forward to it".)<br /><b>Jessie</b>: Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Jessie again.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: We're almost there. After talking with you, I really want to do it! I think you've lit my fuse!
</p><p>(Upon approaching Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Look...you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night. If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: A floating city... Pretty unsettling scenery.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Huh? Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you. ...you jes' full of surprises.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: The upper world...a city on a plate... It's 'cuz of that &amp;^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are sufferin'! And the city below is full of polluted air. On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe... 'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I know... no one lives in the slums because they want to. It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its rails take it.

</p><p>(Upon reaching Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now. The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion! Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that! Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret in front of 7th Heaven.)<br />

</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud? Welcome home, Cloud. Looks like everything went well. Did you fight with Barret? 
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Yeah".)<br /><b>Tifa</b>: I should have known. He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little. I was worried.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Not this time".)<br /><b>Tifa</b>: Hmm. You've grown up. When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of a hat.</li></ul>
<p>(Menu text appears for name entry.)<br />
<b>On-screen</b>: Please enter a name.
</p><p>(Upon selecting the name "Tifa", if flowers were bought.)<br />

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No big.
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Give it to Tifa".)<br /></li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful. Maybe I should fill the store with flowers. Cloud, this one still has roots. I can probably start others from it.
</p>

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "No".)<br /><b>Biggs</b>: What!? You tellin' me you're too good to drink with me? Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Yeah, why not?")<br /><b>Biggs</b>: Oh!! That's more like it!! Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "About what?".)<br /><b>Wedge</b>: Tifa always lets me taste her cooking. And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly. Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous.</li>

<p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud. Are you feeling all right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...yeah... Why?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa after all above dialogue.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: You'd better go down below.
</p><p>(Upon interacting with TV.)<br />
<b>President Shinra</b>: .........today the No.1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing. It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror. But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear. I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Wedge.)<br />
<b>Wedge</b>: You think I'm a little too uptight?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Yeah...")<br /><b>Wedge</b>: The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor. Cloud, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous? Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be it.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "No...")<br /><b>Wedge</b>: Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, but I'm a coward at heart.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Jessie.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: Oops... Hey, look at the news... What a blast. Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me. Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Jessie again.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: Hey, that was my bomb's debut. Makes me kinda proud.
</p><p>(Upon approaching Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Yo, Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya. Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: None. I'm positive.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You sound pretty sure.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here now.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Don't go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ............
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yeah, you're strong. Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are. But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now! Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Stayin' with Shinra? You asked me a question and I answered it...that's all.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Shucks!! ............money...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Marlene.)<br />
<b>Marlene</b>: Papa, you're so great!
</p><p>(Upon returning to pinball machine.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Wait, Cloud!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Tifa! Let him go! Looks like he still misses the Shinra!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Shut up! I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER! But don't get me wrong! I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Wedge.)<br />
<b>Wedge</b>: .......Cloud. You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me. Cloud... You just want friends. Isn't that right? 
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Blow off".)<br /><b>Wedge</b>: Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me. If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "I really don't care".)<br /><b>Wedge</b>: You're terrible. Real cold blooded.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Jessie.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: Money... Oh my. It must have been for a lot of it. Sure! Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement. Now let me figure this out. Oh stop it, Cloud! Did you hear me?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Straighten things up with everyone for me.
</p><p>(Upon attempting to leave 7th Heaven.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sorry Tifa...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying. Someone has to do something.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So let Barret and his buddies do something about it. It's got nothin' to do with me.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You damn right we'll do something about it. N' you stay outta this Tifa!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: So! You're really leaving&#160;!? You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend&#160;!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What......?
</p><p>(After selecting either "How can you say that!" or "......Sorry".)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ......You forgot the promise, too.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Promise?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: So you DID forget.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Remember......Cloud. It was seven years ago...
</p><p>(During flashback in Nibelheim.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Look, the well. Do you remember?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah...back then. I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little cold.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Sorry I'm late. You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: Come this spring...I'm leaving this town for Midgar.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: ...All boys are leaving our town.
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: But I'm different from all of them. I'm not just going to find a job. I want to join SOLDIER. I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth!
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Sephiroth... The Great Sephiroth. Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: ...I probably won't be able to come back to this town for a while.
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: ...huh?
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: I'll try.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Hey, why don't we make a promise? Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind...... You come save me, all right?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: What?
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me. I want to at least experience that once.
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: What?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: Ha, ha, ha! What's that!
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: You're laughing at me!

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER! A promise is a promise! Here!!
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Received Barret's stash, 1500 gil!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: This is my pay? Don't make me laugh.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: What......!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: It's ok, it's ok.

<p>(Upon talking to Tifa the next day.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Good Morning! Cloud! Did you sleep well?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Barret's snoring kept me up......")<br /><b>Tifa</b>: psstpsst... (keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an operation.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Next to you, who wouldn't?".)<br /><b>Tifa</b>: I don't know what you mean.</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm going this time.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first. I'll fill you in on the train.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yo! Cloud! Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you! I, uh,...... I don't really know how to use Materia! I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use it!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...sigh...
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Ok, I'll explain it".)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Sure, I'll explain how Materia works. First, access the menu. You know the basic functions. The triangle button brings up the menu. Directional buttons move the cursor, like this. Select each menu by using the OK button. If you want to leave the menu, just push the CANCEL button. See? Let's go ahead. Now you're in this menu. Select [Materia] sub menu. Select who you want to use it. Now look at my weapon here. Each weapon and armor has slots in it. Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove any Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's just one thing you have to be careful of. Whenever you equip Materia, your situation changes. Parts of you may become stronger... while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. On the left side of the screen, you can see the Materia's effect on you. It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia. But try out various things. Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu. Ok, that's about it. I'll give you some advanced tips later.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Shi......! What's this 'It wasn't that tough!' crap! I'm clueless...... Well, you handle the Materia then!
</p><p>(Upon selecting "You wouldn't understand".)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!? Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the Materia!
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: [Materia System] Access the menu and select [Materia] to equip Materia.
</p><p>(If the player has not yet talked to Tifa in the morning.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: I'm going this time.
</p><p>(If the player has already talked to Tifa, or after the previous line.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs. He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!
</p><p><b>Marlene</b>: All right!! Good Luck.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Marlene.)<br />
<b>Marlene</b>: Take care!
</p><p>(Upon entering the train to Sector 5.)<br />

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: What should we do?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Well we can't let them catch us, can we? Then, there's only one thing left.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: They're also involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side. Spying, murder...you know.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: They look like it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be in SOLDIER!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Maybe you do. You want to join?

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: ......Oh, nothing.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Nothing...?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Right, nothing!

<p>(Regardless of the previous choice.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: Well, that's...nice. Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you the way.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You gotta be kidding. Why do you want to put yourself in danger again?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: I'm used to it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Used to it!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......Well, don't know... getting help from a girl...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: A girl!! What do you mean by that!?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say something like that!?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: But dear...I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind. But if you must go,why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Yeah, you're right, mom.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Aeris, please go and make the bed.

<b>Elmyra</b>: That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah. Rather I used to be...
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: ...... I don't know how to say this, but...Would you please leave here, tonight? Without telling Aeris.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Elmyra again.)<br />
<b>Elmyra</b>: SOLDIER...the last thing Aeris needs is to get her feelings hurt again...
</p><p>(Upon entering the second floor of Aeris's house.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is a little dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Cloud... Good night.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Oh, man...

</p><p><b>Grey text</b>: Ever since that time.
</p><p><b>Cloud's mother</b>: My, how you've grown. I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: ...Not really.
</p><p><b>Cloud's mother</b>: ...I'm worried about you. There are a lot of temptations in the city... I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: ...I'm all right.
</p><p><b>Cloud's mother</b>: You should have... an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you. I think that would be the perfect type for you.
</p><p><b>Cloud (in flashback)</b>: ......I'm not interested.
</p><p>(After the flashback ends.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: ...I must've fallen asleep.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sector 7's past Sector 6... I should be all right by myself...

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Can't get caught this time...

<b>Aeris</b>: You're up bright and early.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: How could I ask you to go along when I knew it would be dangerous?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Are you done?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th Heaven. I'll take you there. Come on!
</p><p>(Upon reaching the Sector 6 playground outside Wall Market.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: The gate to Sector 7's in there.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home?

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "See her home".)<br /><b>Aeris</b>: Isn't that a little out of the way?<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, I guess so.</li>

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: What rank were you?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Rank?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: You know, in SOLDIER.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Oh, I was... First Class.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Just the same as him.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The same as who?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: My first boyfriend.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You were...serious?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: No. But I liked him for a while.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I probably knew him. What was his name?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: It doesn't really matter.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Huh? Hey, back there......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa!?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd...

<b>Aeris</b>: ...Tifa?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Nice to meet you. I'm Aeris. Cloud's told me a lot about you.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...And you are? Hey you're the one with Cloud in the park...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Right, with Cloud.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Oh......
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What do you mean, 'Don't worry'...about what?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No, don't misunderstand. Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Right, Cloud?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud?

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hey, give me a chance to answer.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm all right. Aeris helped me out.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Oh, Aeris did...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah, ummm......
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Aeris.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: Please, go on with your private conversation.
</p><p>(Upon attempting to leave the room.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: Hey, what's the secret?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa again.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ...I'm glad you're OK.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Thanks. What happened?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man. So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That's when the Don's name popped up.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Right, Don Corneo. Barret told me to leave the lech alone... But something's been bothering me.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind. Corneo is looking for a bride. Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well...... Anyway, I have to be the girl ...or I'm out for tonight.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Sorry...but I overheard... If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I guess so, but...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: We have two here, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No, Aeris! I can't have you get involved.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No, I don't want Tifa in...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Is it all right?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger. Do you trust me?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aeris.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Call me Aeris.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: He---y!! It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting! I told you not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays... Hurry up, will ya!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is...... Me......right?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You're right, there was no need...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: ...to ask.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Ha ha...You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad... I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Aeris).<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the guard outside Corneo's office.)<br />

Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.

</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Break the support!?
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums... I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.

<p><b>President Shinra</b>: How are the preparations going?
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Ha, ha, ha!! Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to this.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a group with only a few members...
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: ...No. But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why...
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Reeve, you should flush those personal problems in the morning!
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: The Mayor's against this anyway...
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Mayor? He just sits in this building all day feeding his face! You still call that a Mayor?
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Now if you'll excuse me sir!
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go somewhere.
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then we'll send in the rescue operation care of Shinra, Inc.... Heh, heh, heh...this is perfect.

<p>(After arriving in Sector 6 following the fall of the plate.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Marlene! MARLENE!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: MAR---LE---NE!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Biggs!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Wedge!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Jessie!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Goddamn it!!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Dammit!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: What the hell's it all for!?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ARGGHHHH!!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hey, Barret!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ARGGHHHH!!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hey!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: URGHHHH!!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: God damn...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Marlene...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......... Barret......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Marlene is... I think Marlene is safe.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ......huh?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Right before they took Aeris, she said, "Don't worry, she's all right." She was probably talking about Marlene.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: R, really!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Biggs...... Wedge... Jessie......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: All three of them were in the pillar.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Think I don't know that? But...we, all of us fought together. I don't wanna think of them as dead!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...and the other people in Sector 7.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: This is all screwed up! They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: No, Tifa! That ain't it! Hell no!! It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra! They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to... build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold! If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet! Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: .........I don't know.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: It's not that. I'm not sure about...me. My feelings.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: An'what about you?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: .........
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yo!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Where's he think he's goin'?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Oh! Aeris!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene with.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Damn! Marlene!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now.
</p><p>(Upon approaching the pipe downward in the Sector 6 junk yard.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Cloud! Take me to Marlene!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You're going to help Aeris?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah... But before that, there's something I want to know.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What's that?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...it's about the Ancients.
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth...?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Are you all right?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Pull it together, man!
</p><p>(Upon entering Aeris's house.)<br />
<b>Elmyra</b>: Cloud......wasn't it? It's about Aeris, isn't it?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Sorry. The Shinra have her.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: I know. They took her from here.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: They were here?
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: That's what Aeris wanted...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Why is Shinra after Aeris?
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Aeris is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: ...Not her real mother. Oh...it must have been 15 years ago...
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: ...during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai. One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he was coming home on leave. My husband never came back. I wonder if something happened to him? No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled. I went to the station everyday. Then, one day.........
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war. Her last words were, "Please take Aeris somewhere safe." My husband never came back. I had no child. I was probably lonely. So I decided to take her home with me.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Aeris and I became close very quickly.That child loved to talk. She used to talk to me about everything. She told me she escaped from some kind of research laboratory somewhere. And that her mother had already returned to the planet, so she wasn't lonely...and many other things.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Returned to the planet?
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky, But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child in many ways.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Mom. Please don't cry.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Aeris just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her if something happened...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Someone dear to you has just died. His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to the planet.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: At that time I didn't believe her. But... Several days later... We received a notice saying my husband died... ...and that's how it was. A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day...
</p><p><b>Tseng</b>: We want you to return Aeris to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: No! Never!
</p><p><b>Tseng</b>: Aeris, you're a very special child. You are of special blood. Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Of course I heard it. That she was an 'Ancient'.
</p><p><b>Tseng</b>: The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness. Aeris will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums. That is why Shinra would like Aeris's cooperation......
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
</p><p><b>Tseng</b>: But Aeris, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: No, I don't!
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: But I knew. I knew about her mysterious powers... She tried so hard to hide it, so I acted as though I never noticed.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years...
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: The Shinra needed her, So I guess they wouldn't harm her.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But why now......
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: She brought a little girl here with her. On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get away fast enough. She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Must be Marlene.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Marlene!! Aeris was caught because of Marlene!?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm ...really...sorry...
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. What would happen to Marlene, if I... But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight. 'Cause if I don't...the planet's gonna die. So I'm gonna keep fightin'! But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with her...always. See? I'm goin' in circles, now.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: ...I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: It's my fault... I was the one who got Aeris involved in this.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Don't say that. Aeris doesn't think that.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa again.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: I feel so depressed.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Elmyra.)<br />
<b>Elmyra</b>: ...sigh...
</p><p>(Upon entering Marlene's room upstairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: I'm so glad...... I'm so glad you're all right...
</p><p><b>Marlene</b>: Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!
</p><p>(Upon leaving the room.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Cloud!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You gonna go help Aeris, right? She's done so much for me...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! I'm comin', too!
</p><p><b>Marlene</b>: Guess what? Guess what? Aeris was asking me lots of questions. Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!
</p><p>(Upon answering either "I don't know" or "Let's hope so", the conversation ends.)<br />
</p><p>(Upon talking to Marlene after.)
</p>
<ul><li>(If the player answered "I don't know".)<br /><b>Marlene</b>: Stupid!</li>
<li>(If the player answered "Let's hope so".)<br /><b>Marlene</b>: I won't tell Tifa.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon interacting with the bed on the left.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Looks like I could get some rest here...
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Sleep", Cloud will sleep and HP and MP will be restored. Upon selecting "Don't want to sleep", nothing happens.)
</p><p>(Upon leaving the house.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: You're going after Aeris, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm coming with you.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. ...You gotta be prepared for the worst.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I know. Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit. If I stayed here...I'll go crazy.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Yes, I don't mind.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: ...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
</p><p>(After leaving the house.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: How do we get to the Shinra Building?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: There ain't no train that goes up there anymore...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Elmyra after returning to the house.)<br />
<b>Elmyra</b>: I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Marlene after returning to the house.)<br />
<b>Marlene</b>: Daddy, Tifa, Cloud! Please bring Aeris back!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man on the left counter in the Weapon Store in Wall Market.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: You goin' up to the plate? You better have a Battery.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You're gonna sell me something you just found?
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for each?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "All right, I'll take them".
<ul><li>(If the player has enough gil.)<br /><b>On-screen</b>: Received "Batteries"!</li>
<li>(If the player does not have enough gil.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Hmm, looks like you're a little short, son. Come back again.</li></ul></li>
<li>(Upon selecting "I think you're full of it".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: All right then, go see for yourself. You'll be back again.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon approaching Corneo's mansion.)<br />
<b>Kid</b>: Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the kid in front of the wire next to the wall.)<br />
<b>Kid 1</b>: Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary......Brrr.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Can we climb it?
</p><p><b>Kid 1</b>: Yeah. It leads to the Upper World.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Awright! We'll climb this wire!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Just a normal wire.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You're right. This is the only way to save Aeris...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you feel.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Let's go!
</p><p>(While climbing up.)<br />
<b>Kid 2</b>: Oh man! This is horrible...
</p><p><b>Kid 3</b>: Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.
</p><p>(Upon interacting with battery box for the first time.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: ...maybe if I put a battery in... The propeller might work.
</p><p>(If the player did not obtain batteries from the shopkeeper.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: It might work if I put a battery in it.
</p><p>(If the player did obtain batteries.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: I guess I'll just have to believe the shopkeeper.
</p><p>(Upon interacting with the second and third battery boxes.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Need a battery here, too.
</p><p>(When in front of the swinging bar.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Looks like the only way is to jump onto that bar. Should make it if I jump before it comes too close. (use OK button to jump)
</p><p>(Upon failing a jump by jumping too early.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Jumped too soon...
</p><p>(Upon failing by jumping too late.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Jumped too late...

<p>(Upon reaching the front of the Shinra Building.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Hey, you oughta know this building well.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Not really, now that I think about it, This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I heard about this place before. Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees. Must be where they took Aeris. The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's not going to work! We've got to find another way...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, Aeris'll...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I know that! But if we get caught here... Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Let's bust on in!".)<br /><b>Barret</b>: That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Let's sneak in quietly".)<br /><b>Tifa</b>: See? Let's be careful and find a different route!</li></ul>
<p>(Upon entering the building through the lobby, regardless of the dialogue option the player chose.)<br />
<b>Receptionist</b>: Excuse me! If you don't have an appointment, you'll just have to...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Don't need no appointment... This is a 'mergency! Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta the way!! Yaagghh!
</p><p><b>NPCs</b>:
</p>
<ul><li>Who do they think they are?</li>
<li>Y, You don't think that's AVALANCHE?</li>
<li>Intruders! Seize them!!</li></ul>
<p>(After defeating the following encounter.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Let's go to the top!
</p><p>(Upon interacting with the round elevators.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Nothing. Have to find another way up, I guess...
</p><p>(Upon using the elevators at the back if the player did not go past the sixth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ......What's wrong?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved Aeris. I should have known that was impossible though...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Heh, heh, heh.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What is it? You're givin' me the willies.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: So there are times when even you fight for other people. I am impressed.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Who cares if you're impressed...?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Y'know,I ain't so good at sayin' this,but... Sorry...for lotsa things.
</p><p>(When an alarm goes off in the elevator.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Wh, what the!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Look!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: DA-MN...!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I don't care where, Cloud! Just stop it!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: What's going on!?
</p><p>(Upon meeting a Shinra employee after pushing the button to stop the elevator on floors 29, 38, 47, or 56.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Oh man!!
</p><p>(If this is the first time meeting the Shinra employee on this floor.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: No, uh, that's all right. My mistake. I'm, uh, not getting on.
</p><p>(After already meeting the Shinra employee on this floor.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: You, you're still driving...? Uh, I'll pass again.
</p><p>(As the Shinra employee runs away after either previous line.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Oh man!!
</p><p>(When the player enters the side door to climb the stairs of the Shinra Building.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Yo... You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Well we've got to get to Aeris to help her somehow.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Talk about out of the way...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Y, yo Tifa! Don't go off alone!
</p><p>(Upon leaving the stairs.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Wait a minute, Cloud!
</p><p>(Upon reaching the sixth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Don't know... Why...the hell... We gotta...climb...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved Aeris.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I doubt that's possible though...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...heh heh heh.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.
</p><p>(Upon reaching the thirteenth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured wrong I guess.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Who cares what you figured!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: heh heh heh......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What's that supposed to mean, Tifa?
</p><p>(Upon reaching the twentieth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: ...how much farther do these stairs go on?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Why don't you ask them?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya think?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Of course not!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Right...couldn't be that...
</p><p>(Upon reaching the twenty-seventh floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Are we there yet?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Not yet.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...there yet?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I said not yet!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yo...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being there, ok!?
</p><p>(Upon reaching the thirty-fourth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: And take just as long going down as you did coming up?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ............
</p><p>(Upon reaching the fortieth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: C'mon, Barret. Pull it together!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood... 'cept for this arm of mine. Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or somethin'......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yaah! Barret! You go first!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: All right, all right!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud, you go on ahead too!!
</p><p>(Upon reaching the forty-first floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Yo... What floor is this?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...I gave up counting.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: That Shinra... They're just no damn good.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: .........
</p><p>(Upon reaching the forty-eighth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: huff... Man, I'm beat...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Would you stop acting like a retard and climb!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: It's just a bit more!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...maybe.
</p><p>(Upon reaching the fifty-ninth floor of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: F...finally... M...made it... N...never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: huff...puff... this really takes it out of you... But this is it. We'd better get ready...!
</p><p>(Upon trying to leave the fifty-ninth floor using the stairs or an elevator.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Hey Cloud! You come all this way, you thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Yeah".)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: We ain't got no time for that! Stop messin' around, boy!
</p><p>(Upon selecting "No......".)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Yeah, that's right! Let's go on then!
</p><p>(Upon approaching the guards.)<br />
<b>Guard</b>: Destroy the intruders!
</p><p>(After defeating the Mighty Grunt soldiers.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: What's this?
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Received Key Item "Keycard 60"!
</p><p>(When interacting with the elevator, it provides the options '1floor', '59"', '60"', '61"', '62"', '63"', '64"', '65"', '66"', or '69"'.)
</p><p>(Upon attempting to select a greyed out floor.)<br />
<b>On-screen</b>: You don't have a Card Key
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa while using the elevator.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: I hope Aeris is all right.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret while using the elevator.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the guards on floor 60.)<br />
<b>Guard</b>: What're you doing here!? No unauthorized people are allowed here!! People like you don't belong here! Go on, get out!
</p><p>(Upon entering the top-left room.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around. Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: When those guards turn around, MOVE!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Stay in the shadows!
</p><p>(Upon reaching the middle successfully.)<br />
<b>On-screen</b>: Wait for the soldiers to let down their guard, then push the [O] button to signal the others!
</p><p>(Upon sneaking past successfully.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Ok! We gonna rock!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Remember, we're here to save Aeris.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Hell, I know that!
</p><p>(Upon being caught by the guards.)<br />
<b>Guard</b>: Hey there! What do you think you're doing there!?
</p><p>(After defeating two Mighty Grunts in the following encounter upon being caught less than four times.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: What the hell're ya doin'? Come on gotta do it again!
</p><p>(After defeating two Mighty Grunts upon being caught a fourth time.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: I shoulda known it'd turn out like this... If I'd known it'd be like this in the first place...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Shhh! Now let's move on.
</p><p>(Upon talking to an employee in the grey suit near elevators on floor 61, before getting Keycard 62.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?

</p><p>(Upon talking to Mayor Domino in his office.)<br />
<b>Domino</b>: Hmm? Oh, and who might you be? You all must be those...ahem... Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of Midgar. Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc. My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents... Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh...... You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard. Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard! Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Hart after speaking to Domino.)<br />
<b>Hart</b>: Did you speak with the Mayor? What? A password? Oh, I get it... He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra. Maybe I can help you.

<li>(Upon selecting "Give him the money" if the player has enough gil.)<br /><b>Hart</b>: Oh, my...well, Thank you very much.
<ul><li>(If this is Hart's first hint.)<br /><b>Hart</b>: Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc.... Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries. Pay careful attention to the files in each room. The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door.</li>
<li>(If this is Hart's second hint.)<br /><b>Hart</b>: Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library. Look carefully at the numbers on each file.</li>
<li>(If this is Hart's third hint.)<br /><b>Hart</b>: There is a number at the beginning of each file name. Of course there's a number even on the files that don't belong in that library. Match the number with the letters in the title of the file. If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and... well, you get the idea.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>(Upon selecting "Forget it", "Uh, nothing", or "Forget it!", depending on the conversation.)<br />
<b>Hart</b>: ...I see. Then, I guess that's that. Good luck finding it on your own. If you still can't find it. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime...

</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: How long will the research take?
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Ugh.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Cloud, help!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What do you think you're doin'?
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them are on the brink of extinction... If I don't help, all these animals will disappear.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...animal? That's terrible! Aeris is a human being!

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists. Is that right?

<b>Cloud</b>: What's happened?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa after interacting with the guard.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Tifa... Wake up!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What's wrong?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Something's wrong. Look outside.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa after she leaves the cell.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: I wonder what happened...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: He should have the key on him...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Come on, Tifa, get Aeris. I'll go help Barret and the others.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa or Aeris in Aeris's cell.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: This's kinda eerie...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Must've been attacked by...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret or Red XIII.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Barret, Red XIII ...come with me. Something's wrong.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret after he leaves the cell.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: The hell's goin' on!?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: No human could've done this.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: I'll go on ahead.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Aeris or Tifa after Red XIII goes to investigate.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Come on, let's follow Red XIII!
</p><p>(Upon interacting with the broken Jenova tank in Hojo's lab.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: ...Did it get away? Jenova...?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Red XIII outside the Jenova tank.)<br />
<b>Red XIII</b>: Jenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Red XIII on floor 68.)<br />
<b>Red XIII</b>: It looks like it leads up...
</p><p>(Upon approaching President Shinra in his office.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Then this sword must be...!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth's!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...Sephiroth is alive?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: Uh!
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: P, p, p, please, don't kill me!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What happened?
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: Se...Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: Yeah, I saw him! I saw him with my own eyes!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You really saw him?
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his voice too!
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Then what? Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: So he's a good guy then?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!! It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Rufus! &amp;*%$! I forgot about him!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Who's that?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Vice President Rufus. The President's son.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long time...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: I wonder what kinda person he is...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Aeris.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: I've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Red XIII.)<br />
<b>Red XIII</b>: I only know his name.
</p><p>(Upon going outside to the roof.)<br />
<b>Rufus</b>: So... So Sephiroth was actually here. ...By the way.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Who are you guys?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I'm from AVALANCHE!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Same here!
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: ...a flower girl from the slums.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: ...a research specimen.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: What a crew.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You only President, 'cause yer old man died!
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: That's right. I'll let you hear my new appointment speech.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: ...Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to have been working. The population thought that Shinra would protect them. Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra army will help you. It looks perfect on the outside.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: But, I do things differently. I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it like my old man. A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste money on them.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: He likes to make speeches just like his father.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Get outta this building with Aeris!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: What?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'll explain later! Barret! This is the real crisis for the Planet!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: The hell's that supposed to mean?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'll tell you later! Just take my word for it now! I'll go after I take care of him!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Awright, Cloud!
</p><p>(After perspective switches to other party members.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: Cloud... I just thought of something.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...I'll wait for Cloud! Everyone, get to the elevator!
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should check on our equipment.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Hm, exactly.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land!
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: I see. I guess this means we won't become friends.
</p><p>(During battle with Rufus and Dark Nation.)
</p><p>(If Rufus has more than 200 HP, and Cloud's attack did not deal more than 100 damage, 33% chance to trigger.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon approaching one of the elevators on floor 1.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: Quickly! We'll escape out this way......

<b>Barret</b>: I'll go on ahead!

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth is alive. I ...I have to settle the score.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: And that'll save the Planet?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Seems like it.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Awright, I'm going!
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: About the Ancients?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: ......Many things.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I guess this's good bye, Midgar.
</p><p>(Outside the city gate.)
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: We told Aeris's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe too.
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Yeah, she should be".)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. ...Maybe it's for the best.
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Hmm, I don't know".)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: Stop it, Cloud! I'm worried too.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Aeris.)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar...
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Really?...You worried?".)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: A little,...no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?
</p><p>(Upon selecting "It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?".)<br />
<b>Aeris</b>: I thought you'd say that!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ...I guess this is the start of our journey...
</p><p>(Upon selecting "You hate traveling?".)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ...I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not.
</p><p>(Upon selecting "It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?".)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ......Mmm. But you know, it should be all right if you keep your promise.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Red XIII.)<br />

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: 'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. It's too dangerous. Split us into 2 parties...

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Guess everyone's here now.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: So let's hear your story...... You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet. Let's hear it all.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER. After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You call that a friend?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, well...... He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: .........
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So I guess you'd call him a war buddy...... We trusted each other. Until one day......
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: ...one day?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.

</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...this isn't a typical mission.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Good!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Why do you say that?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you. But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over. My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war. That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...I thought you wanted a briefing?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor. There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures. First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Brutal creatures... Where?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Nibelheim... That's where I'm from.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Hmm... hometown...
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: Sir... s, something strange just crashed into our truck!

<p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality than any story you might have heard about him.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: So... Where do you come in?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: .........
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......and then we reached Nibelheim.
</p>
<dl><dt>(During the flashback at Nibelheim.)</dt></dl>
<p><b>Sephiroth</b>: How does it feel? It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right? So how does it feel? I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Ummm... how 'bout your parents?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: What does it matter...? All right, let's go.

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "You want to do what we always do?")<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Shall we practice?<br /><b>NPC</b>: Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That's right.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You can ask questions later.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Tifa, I was only......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Okay Cloud, continue.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: It's a reunion of childhood pals!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......I was really surprised with Tifa.
</p>
<dl><dt>(During the flashback at Nibelheim.)</dt></dl>
<p><b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: ...The town was quiet. Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters. No, maybe they're afraid of us...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest.

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Then take my picture")<br /><b>NPC</b>: Let's do this, Cloud. Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "It's dangerous, get back in your house")<br /><b>NPC</b>: OK, OK,...... So big-headed... You're just his assistant</li></ul></li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "That's right!")<br /><b>Tifa's father</b>: Geez... Big-headed young kid.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Who are you?")<br /><b>Tifa's father</b>: I'm the town's... ...... ......!? Aren't you Cloud?

<p>(Upon entering Cloud's house.)<br />
<b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: This is...... my house. It has nothing to do with that incident five years ago.
</p><p><b>Barret (over narration)</b>: Yo wait, I wanna hear.
</p><p><b>Aeris (over narration)</b>: Me too! It's been a long time, right?
</p><p><b>Barret (over narration)</b>: Tell us more! You saw your family, right?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Don't want to talk about it".)<br /><b>Barret (over narration)</b>: Well I ain't gonna force ya...<br />(After this, the player leaves the house.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "All right......")<br /><b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: I don't know if you could call it a 'family'...... My father... died when I was still very young. That's why my mom...... was living alone in this house.<br /><b>Cloud (over narration)</b>: Yeah, I saw my mom. My mom... she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all. But a few days later, she died... But when I saw her, she looked fine.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Uh...?<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: Ye----s?<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: Cloud!? Welcome home, Cloud!<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Hi, mom.<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: Come, come... Let me take a look at you!<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: Hmmm...... You look so handsome.

I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: ...Not really.<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: ...I'm worried about you. There are a lot of temptations in the city... I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: ...I'm all right.<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: You should have... an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you. I think that would be the perfect type for you.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: ......I'm not interested.<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: Are you eating right?<br /><b>Cloud</b>: I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: Is that so? You can't cook, right? I was worried sick about how you were doing...<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: Cloud...?<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: You know, Cloud......<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: ......isn't that right, Cloud?<br /><b>Cloud's mother</b>: I will always be your mother...<br /><b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: ......Let's stop this......</li></ul>
<p>(Upon attempting to enter Cloud's house again after seeing the flashback.)<br />
<b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: Hey... I can't... remember much else. There's... nothing more to talk about.
</p><p><b>Aeris (over narration)</b>: That's all right, Cloud.
</p><p>(Upon entering Tifa's house.)<br />
<b>Tifa (over narration)</b>:  Cloud...? Did you go into my house?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Yeah...")<br /><b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: I thought you might be home.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "No...")<br /><b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: I remember you weren't there.<br />(After this, the player leaves the house.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon entering Tifa's room.)<br />
<b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Cloud...? Did you go into my room?
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Yeah......", the player can explore further. Upon selecting "No...", the player leaves the house.)

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "No, I didn't", nothing happens.")</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Yeah, I jammed on it".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: ...Now how did this go?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "I forgot", nothing happens.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "I remember", the player can play on the piano.)<br /><b>On-screen</b>: It was Start button to finish.<br />Start button End<br />(If the player plays the "Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII" on the piano.)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: I've heard this melody somewhere before.

<p>(Upon approaching Tifa's desk.)<br />
<b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: The letter...
</p><p><b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Did you read it? My letter?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "I'd never do that!")<br /><b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Of course!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Yeah...")<br /><b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Do you remember what it said...?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "I don't remember...")<br /><b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "I remember clearly")<br /><b>Cloud (over narration)</b>:  I read it... It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that runs the General Store...<br /><b>On-screen</b>: Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago. Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud. But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.<br /><b>On-screen</b>: Well, enough about him. Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything... so out of it. Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean. Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money. ...but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first.<br /><b>On-screen</b>: That's right. I still haven't found a job yet. I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc. I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store.<br /><b>Tifa  (over narration)</b>: Cloud... Do you remember all of it?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "No, that's it")<br /><b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Yeah, I remember it all")<br /><b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Because there was some stuff about me...<br /><b>On-screen</b>: I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim. Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working? Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked? And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.<br /><b>On-screen</b>: We were all talking about you last night. Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back. I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted. Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter! So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again. P.S. Write me back, okay?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>(Upon interacting with the dresser in Tifa's room.)<br />
<b>On-screen</b>: Received "Orthopedic Underwear!"
</p><p><b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: Cloud!!!
</p><p>(Upon selecting "It's true" or "Just kidding. Don't get mad...", the response is the same.)<br />
<b>Tifa (over narration)</b>: ...Cloud. We're talking about something really important here.
</p><p>(Upon entering the house adjacent to Tifa's.)<br />
<b>NPC 1</b>: ...Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.
</p><p><b>NPC 1</b>: Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, Cloud! I didn't recognize you.
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: Shinra----?
</p><p><b>NPC 3</b>: Chinra---?
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: SOLDIER?
</p><p><b>NPC 3</b>: Saltza?
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: Are you going to kill the monsters?
</p><p><b>NPC 3</b>: ......are you going to?
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: He's soooo cool!!
</p><p><b>NPC 3</b>: Way cool!!
</p><p><b>NPC 1</b>: Cloud, you've grown to be a strong man.
</p><p><b>NPC 3</b>: ........................
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: Do your best.
</p><p><b>NPC 3</b>: Do your best.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the innkeeper.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: So, what do you need, Cloud?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Where's Sephiroth?")<br /><b>NPC</b>: Yeah, he's upstairs.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Give me a room to stay.")<br /><b>NPC</b>: It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Let me know the situation of the town.")<br /><b>NPC</b>: Now about the town... A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months. Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this. It was all right when they were building the reactor.<br /><b>NPC</b>: ...while they were still building it. But once it was completed, it's been bad.</li></ul>
<p>Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away. I don't know if the reactor was good or bad... I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But now, what can you do about it...?<br /><b>NPC</b>: Anyhow we've got to get rid of the monsters... Then, we'll all be able to relax a little bit.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Zangan in the inn.)<br />
<b>Zangan</b>: ......Hmmmm
</p><p><b>Zangan</b>: Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: And who are you?
</p><p><b>Zangan</b>: I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial arts. I have 128 students all over the world! In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Did you say Tifa?
</p><p><b>Zangan</b>: Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.
</p><p><b>Zangan</b>: I want to see some Shinra techniques. And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.
</p><p><b>Zangan</b>: Well, good luck.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth in the top floor of the inn.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: What are you looking at?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...This scenery...... I feel like I know this place.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: We're short one bed...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth again.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: .........
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "It's still early".)<br /><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.<br />(Nothing happens.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Yeah, let's get some sleep.")<br /><b>Sephiroth</b>: I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor. I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her...<br />(The next day then commences.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the man with the camera the next day.)<br />
<b>NPC 1</b>: Think they'd let me take a picture?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa's father the next day.)<br />
<b>Tifa's father</b>: If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier on the left.)<br />
<b>NPC 2</b>: I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier on the right.)<br />
<b>NPC 3</b>: ...Late again.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth in front of the exit to Mt. Nibel.)
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Once the guide gets here, we're heading out.
</p><p><b>Tifa's father</b>: Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...Trust me.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'll be all right, Dad! I have two men from SOLDIER with me.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa! You're the guide?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's right. I just happen to be the number one guide in this town.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Then there's no problem if you protect her.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...Let's go.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Ummm... Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento! Tifa, can you ask him for me too......?
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Cheeeeese!
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Great, thank you! I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!
</p><p>(After entering Mt. Nibel.)<br />
<b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel. The cold air of the mountains of Nibel. It was no different...
</p><p>(Upon running back to town and talking to Tifa's father.)<br />
<b>Tifa's father</b>: I hate myself for asking you this, but... Don't take your eyes off of Tifa! Hurry up and go back to her side!
</p><p>(Upon running back to town and talking to Zangan.)<br />
<b>Zangan</b>: Oh? Did you come crying home?
</p><p>(Upon approaching Tifa on Mt. Nibel.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: It gets harder from here! Follow me!
</p><p>(Upon reaching Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Uh... the bridge!!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm... Oh, and Sephiroth... There seems to be one person missing...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here.
</p><p>(Upon entering the cave.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: What's this?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: A mysteriously colored cave...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
</p><p>(Upon leaving through the cave's back exit.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: ...And what's this?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: It's so beautiful...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced. It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also use magic too?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that? ...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the materia. Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet calling up magic...... or so they say.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Magic...... a mysterious power...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Did I say somethin' funny?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'! I still remember how angry he was.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Who was that?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist. He was a walking mass of complexes.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
</p><p>(Upon reaching the Nibel Reactor.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa, you wait here.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm going inside too! I wanna see!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Take care of the lady.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Mm, man! Better take real good care of me then!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth in front of Jenova inside the reactor.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: This is...... Jenova, right? The lock won't open...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken. Cloud, close the valve.
</p><p>(Upon closing the valve.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Why did it break...?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...now I see, Hojo. But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast. This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy... that is, when it's working correctly. Now... what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Uh, umm...... Oh yeah! It becomes a Materia.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take a look.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Look through the window.
</p><p>(Upon interacting with the window.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Wh... what is this!?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako. You're different from the others, but still human. But, what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of Mako, far more than you.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...is this some kind of monster?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters. Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monster's really are.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: H... hey, Sephiroth!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: N... no...... ...Was I?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...Was I created this way too? Am I the same as all these monsters......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Sephiroth.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: You saw it! All of them... were humans...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Human!? No way!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...I've always felt since I was small... That I was different from the others. Special, in some way. But... not like this...
</p><p><b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: Am I...... human? I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time. I was even more surprised by the fact that Shinra was producing monsters.
</p>
<dl><dt>(Back at Kalm)</dt></dl>
<p><b>Barret</b>: Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently. I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so Barret?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: (Why you talkin' to me!?)
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Save game and take a rest".)<br /><b>Barret</b>: Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?<br />(After saving.)<br /><b>Barret</b>: ......I get it.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Keep talking".)<br /><b>Barret</b>: Hmph! Pokin' his damn nose in where it don't belong. Cloud! Why don't you finish that story?<br /><b>Red XIII</b>: (Phew......)</li></ul>
<p><b>Aeris</b>: Tifa... You were waiting outside then?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......Yes.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion...
</p>
<dl><dt>(During the flashback in Nibelheim.)</dt></dl>
<p>(Upon talking to the man with the camera.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: What's Sephiroth doing?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Zangan.)<br />
<b>Zangan</b>: There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Why...?")<br /><b>Cloud</b>:...Why do you ask?<br /><b>Zangan</b>: The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be an embarrassment to the company...<br /><b>Zangan</b>: you pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "No way!")<br /><b>Cloud</b>: It's Sephiroth. He would never do that.<br /><b>Zangan</b>: ...Oh my. You sure do have faith.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Tifa's father.)<br />
<b>Tifa's father</b>: Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier outside one of the mansion's bedrooms.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth in the library at the basement of the mansion.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: ...an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 year old geological stratum. Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient... X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako Reactor 1 approved for use...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: My mother's name is Jenova... Jenova Project... Is this just a coincidence?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Professor Gast... Why didn't you tell me anything? ...Why did you die?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Let me be alone.
</p><p>(Upon leaving the library.)<br />
<b>Cloud (narrating)</b>: Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion... He continued to read as if he were possessed by something, and not once, did the light in the basement go out...
</p><p>(Upon talking to soldier after Cloud wakes up.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Sephiroth seems different.
</p><p>(Upon entering the library after Cloud wakes up.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha......
</p><p>(Upon approaching Sephiroth.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Who is it!?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Hmph... traitor.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Traitor?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you. This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on... At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the Promised Land and supreme happiness.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life. They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without giving back one whit in return! Those are your ancestors.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Long ago, disaster struck this planet. Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid. The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to increase. Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What does that have to do with you?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Don't you get it? An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 2000 years ago. The Jenova Project.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of the Ancients...... no, the Cetra. ...I am the one that was produced.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Pr... produced!?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Yes. Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius scientist, produced me.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: How... how did he...?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Se... Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother.
</p><p>(Upon attempting to leave to Mt. Nibel.)<br />
<b>Zangan</b>: He---y! Is anyone here?
</p><p>(Upon approaching the town after leaving the Shinra Mansion.)<br />
<b>Zangan</b>: Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?
</p><p><b>Zangan</b>: Then come over here and help me! I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man with the camera.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: ...Hey, Ummm... Am I going to die?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: ...Sephi... roth
</p><p>(Upon checking the house on the right.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Terrible... Sephiroth... This is too terrible...
</p><p>(Upon finding Tifa in the Nibel Reactor.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Papa... Sephiroth!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything! I hate them all!
</p><p>(Upon following Tifa to the core.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?
</p><p>(Upon reaching Tifa at the bottom of the stairs.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ...You promised... You promised that you'd come...... when I was in trouble...
</p><p>(Upon approaching Sephiroth inside Jenova's chamber.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Mother, let's take this planet back together. I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth... My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha...... They've come again, mother. With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of this Planet.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: But they... Those worthless creatures are stealing the planet from Mother
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: But now I'm here with you so don't worry
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What about MY sadness!? My family... friends... The sadness of having my hometown taken away from me!? It's the same as your sadness!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about? I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this Planet.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth... I trusted you... No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!
</p>
<dl><dt>(Back in Kalm.)</dt></dl>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: ......and that's the end of my story.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......I don't remember.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: What happened to Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Shinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then. I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......I'm alive, too.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from the Shinra building.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sephiroth......?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Damn! Don't none of this make sense! I'm going, going, going, gone! And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!

<p>(Upon talking to Choco Bill inside the house in Chocobo Farm.)<br />
<b>Choco Bill</b>: Thinking of crossing the marshes?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Yeah".)<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo. That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo. It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom.<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: Midgar Zolom...? It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!! It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes... And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill &amp; Choco Billy Chocobo Farm. To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm. By the way, there was another person heading towards the Marshes. Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a man in a Black Cape.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Not interested".)<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: Hmm, then, I guess that's that.</li></ul>

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Where are they?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear in those areas. But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. They very cautious animals by nature.
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Chocobo Lure?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: 'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos. If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they won't appear.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Go on", returns to previous menu.)</li></ul></li>
<li>(Upon selecting "How do I catch one?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters. But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters. That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch the Chocobo.
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "And then?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from the slightest things. But, if you use 'Greens' They'll focus on that, and won't run away.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "That all you can talk about?", returns to previous menu.)</li></ul></li>
<li>(Upon selecting "What else?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt. Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Not interested".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: Well then, shall we get down to business? I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now. You want it?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Buy it".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: Thanks! It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either. Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type of 'Greens' you feed them.<br />(Opens Vegetable Store.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Don't buy it".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: Mmmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one.</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<p><b>Rude</b>: It's difficult to explain what the Turks do...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Kidnapping, right?
</p><p><b>Rude</b>: To put it negatively... you could say that. ...But, that's not all there is to it, anymore.
</p><p><b>Rude</b>: ............
</p><p><b>Rude</b>: ............
</p><p><b>Elena</b>: Sir! It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't force it!
</p><p><b>Rude</b>: ...Then Elena, explain.
</p><p><b>Elena</b>: I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short of people. ...Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks, ...
</p><p><b>Elena</b>: In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed. And to try and stop you every step of the way.
</p><p><b>Elena</b>: Wait a minute, it's the other way around... You're the ones that are getting in our way.
</p><p><b>Tseng</b>: ...Elena. You talk too much.

</p><p><b>Tseng</b>: I thought I gave you other orders. Now go. Don't forget to file your report.
</p><p><b>Elena</b>: Oh! Right! Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for Junon Harbor!

</p><p><b>Rude &amp; Elena</b>: Yes sir!
</p><p><b>Rude</b>: ...Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave him healed. He wants to show his affection for you all... with a new weapon.
</p><p><b>Tseng</b>: Well, then...
</p>
<ul><li>(If Aeris is is in the party.)<br /><b>Tseng</b>: Aeris... Long time no see.

Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care.<br /><b>Aeris</b>: ...strange, hearing that from you.<br /><b>Tseng</b>: Well then, stay out of Shinra's way.</li>

<li><b>Yuffie</b>: So what's the story? Hey Cloud. Give us a quick run down.</li></ul>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "I'll try".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: ...I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the planet...

<li>(If Tifa is in the party but Aeris is not.)<br /><b>Aeris</b>: Maybe I should get a tan for a change.

</p><p>(During flashback in Corel.)
<b>Barret (narrating)</b>: ...My hometown, Corel's always been a coal mining town. It's so dusty, but calm and so poor...... A real small town, this one. That's the first time I ever heard the word "Mako Reactor" mentioned since that time...
</p><p><b>Village Headman</b>: What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne...
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it. We have no right to throw it all away so easily!
</p><p><b>Barret (in flashback)</b>: But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times.
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Right, everything is Mako, now.
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed.
</p><p><b>Barret (in flashback)</b>: Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it! But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!
</p><p><b>Village Headman</b>: Dyne...you've got to understand.
</p><p><b>Barret (narrating)</b>: That's how the Corel Reactor was built......and completed. We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
</p><p><b>Barret (narrating)</b>: It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days. Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops. All the townspeople... All my relatives...... Everyone...everything......
</p><p>(After flashback is complete.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Shinra troops? What for!?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: There was an explosion at a reactor. Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's so terrible!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself. Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: That's why... that's why I get so pissed off!! Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too...
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on!

</p><p>(Back in Corel Prison.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more. ...I was depressed for a while. But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in. Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me. But, his was the left arm.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: But...Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too. He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace. An' that's why, I gotta go alone.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Do whatever you want... Is that what you want to hear? Well, I can't let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I'm gonna have nightmares.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Barret, this isn't the end.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Weren't you going to save the Planet?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now.

</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years... A voice I'll never forget...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday... I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Listen to me Dyne. I want to...
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: What's that?......I hear her voice.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ......?
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me... not to hate your rotten guts. That's why I didn't hunt you down...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me. But...What're you doin' in a place like this? Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: ...Why!? The hell do you care for!? Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: I don't CARE what the reason is! All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses... What's left is a world of despair and emptiness...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: .......
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: You still want to hear 'why'? ...All right, I'll tell you. 'Cause I want to destroy everything. The people of this city. This city itself. The whole world! I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor...... Marlene......
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Dyne,Marlene...... Marlene's still alive.
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: ......?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure. That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end. That's when I found her... ...found Marlene.

</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight.

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Dyne...are you insane!?
</p><p><b>Dyne</b>: Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I want to go up.
</p><p><b>Mr.Coates</b>: R, right. Did you kill Dyne? You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing. ...So Dyne's dead... Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little. Dyne didn't care who anyone was......

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Then, will you get us outta here?
</p><p><b>Mr.Coates</b>: Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken. I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here. That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's held up there, in the Gold Saucer. And, only one racer can go up at a time.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Say what!?
</p><p><b>Mr.Coates</b>: Noooo! Really, even if you threaten me!! A rule's a rule. I can't change it. If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I can't do that!
</p><p><b>Mr.Coates</b>: Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal with Dio.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Awright then. Cloud, you go. We'll wait down here. Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!

</p><p><b>Ester</b>: Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud.
</p><p><b>Mr.Coates</b>: All right then, Cloud. I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details.
</p><p>(Inside the elevator.)<br />
<b>Ester</b>: Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You just concentrate on the race. Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals. Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the money, some only for glory... And then there're people like you. Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo.
</p>

In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own. But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen. You can't really help on this one. But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them. When you're riding, use the <img alt="Square" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation Button S.png" data-image-key="Playstation_Button_S.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/2/22/Playstation_Button_S.png/revision/latest?cb=20101022075233" class="lazyload" /> Button to Speed Up and the <img alt="X" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-X.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-X.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/3/3d/Playstation-Button-X.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091013" class="lazyload" /> Button to Slow Down. But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast. And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the <img alt="Circle" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-C.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-C.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/0/04/Playstation-Button-C.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091158" class="lazyload" /> Button to get a boost of speed. Of course your stamina runs out faster though. There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast. For these kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down. Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line, Push the <span class="invert-dark"><img alt="Start" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation Button Start.png" data-image-key="Playstation_Button_Start.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/0/07/Playstation_Button_Start.png/revision/latest?cb=20101022071425" class="lazyload" /></span> button to end the race.</li>

<p>(Upon talking to Red XIII by the stairs.)<br />
<b>Red XIII</b>: Here is where I was...I mean, ...this is my hometown. My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful canyon and the Planet. My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father left her...... I am the last of my race.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Cowardly father?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Yes. My father was a wastrel. And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect this place. My journey ends here.

<p>(The other two party members can be found and spoken to in a certain spot in Cosmo Canyon. They are found in their spot after reaching the the floor of Cosmo Canyon, the floor directly below the observatory, before talking to Bugenhagen.)

<li>(Upon talking to Tifa in Pub "Starlet".)<br /><b>Tifa</b>: Red XIII...... I wonder what's happened to Red XIII...? He's as excited as a little boy.</li>
<li>(Upon talking to Barret in the Elder's Room.)<br /><b>Barret</b>: There was this guy who studied 'Planetary Life' here. He couldn't take things the way they were, so he went to Midgar to form AVALANCHE. Wanna hear more?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Go on".)<br /><b>Barret</b>: Guess you could say this is where AVALANCHE was born. I always wanted to come here... And...I finally......made it. A lot...happened...

<b>Red XIII</b>: Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen. He is incredible. He knows everything.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit. Nanaki is still a child you see.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity. So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: 15 or 16!?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: ......grandfather. I want to be an adult. I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet. To do that now would destroy you in the long run. Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very stars from the great city of Midgar. You've seen it, haven't you?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose perspective. When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that you know absolutely nothing.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......When the planet dies?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now... But it's not long off.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: How do you know this?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I hear the cries of the Planet.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What's that?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: The sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, planets are born, and die.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What was that?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet. Didn't you hear it? As if to say... I hurt, I suffer......
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: They have come here on a journey to save the planet. Why don't you show them your apparatus?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo!
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Bugenhagen! Several odd looking people have come.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: He brought friends too. I'll go get them.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Cloud, please call one of them. Only three people can fit in grandfather's machine.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Bugenhagen or attempting to enter the hologram room.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: Don't worry. My machine won't run away. You go and invite your friends.

<li>(Upon talking to Yuffie in the Materia Shop.)<br /><b>Yuffie</b>: God. I HATE studying!</li>
<li>(Upon talking to Cait Sith on the third floor.)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: What did they say?</li></ul>

<b>Red XIII</b>: Don't worry about me. I've seen it many times. It's my first time back in a while. Let me rest for a bit...
</p><p>(Upon returning to Bugenhagen in the Bugen Research Center having formed a party.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come on in.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Bugenhagen in the Observatory.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then let's begin. I'll be stand there.
</p><p>(Depending on the other party members, in order of priority. Whoever has the highest priority will speak their line, regardless of their position in the party.)<br />
</p>
<ul><li><b>Aeris</b>: So pretty...It's just like the real thing!</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: Wow! It's just like the real thing!</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Woa! Wooooah! Pretty good, surprisin' me!</li>
<li><b>Barret</b>: This is really somethin'!</li></ul>
<p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory. All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic System.
</p><p>(Depending on the other party members, in order of priority.)<br />
</p>
<ul><li><b>Aeris</b>: Hey! A shooting star!<br /><b>Aeris</b>: Wow, how wonderful.</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: Look, look! A shooting star!<br /><b>Tifa</b>: Oh! This is amazing!!</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Wh, what the? A shooting star?<br /><b>Yuffie</b>: Whew!!</li>
<li><b>Barret</b>: Whoa! Shootin' stars!<br /><b>Barret</b>: This's really somethin'!</li></ul>
<p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it? Well, let's get to the subject.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Eventually...all humans die. What happens to them after they die? The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: The soul too returns to the Planet. And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same. The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet. They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Lifestream... In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet. 'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget. A new life...children are blessed with Spirit energy and are brought into the world. Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet... Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the world.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this. Spirit energy makes all things possible, trees, birds, and humans. Not just living things. But Spirit energy makes it possible for Planets to be Planets. What happens if that Spirit energy were to disappear?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: ......These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within nature. When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it can't accomplish its true purpose.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You're talking about Mako energy, right?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it. Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away. In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet...
</p><p>(After the presentation.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: The story of the planets... and those who lived with them... You want to know more? Then you must listen to the words of the elders.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Bugenhagen.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: Nanaki? His father a coward? So that's it... Nanaki's been thinking that all this time...

<ul><li><b>Red XIII</b>: ......</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud... Bonfires are funny, aren't they? They make you remember all sorts of things.<br /><b>Tifa</b>: You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago...<br /><b>Tifa</b>: ......It's nothing. No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask...<br /><b>Cloud</b>: What is it...?<br /><b>Tifa</b>: It feels like... it feels like you're going far away... You really, really are...... you...right?</li>
<li><b>Barret</b>: Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born... I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate... Biggs... Wedge... Jessie... Now they're all gone... died for the planet.<br /><b>Barret</b>: ...Really? To save the planet? We all... we all hate the Shinra... Do I even got a to go on? Will they...... ...will they ever forgive me?<br /><b>Barret</b>: ...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing. If there's anything I can do, to save the planet...or the people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it! I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care......let 'em decide for 'emselves.<br /><b>Barret</b>: Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!! Again... Again...AVALANCHE's born again!</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: What a boring place, just like I thought. I wanna go somewhere! Let's go find some Materia!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: I wonder how many years it's been... Gosh, it brings back memories......</li>
<li><b>Aeris</b>: I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things. About the Cetra... And the Promised Land... I'm......alone... I'm all alone now...<br /><b>Cloud</b>: But I'm......we're here for you, right?<br /><b>Aeris</b>: I know. I know, but... I am the only......Cetra.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Does that mean we can't help?<br />(Upon talking to her again.)<br /><b>Aeris</b>: ......</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Red XIII after talking to the others.)<br />
<b>Red XIII</b>: ...Long ago. ...When I was still very small. We were all around this flame...
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: No, never mind...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What happened?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: It's about my parents. When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy... And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is full of anger...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: ...You really can't forgive your father...?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Of course. He......left mother for dead. When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving mother and the people of the Canyon!
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: ...Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: ...?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: The place may be dangerous.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?
</p><p>(Upon talking to remaining characters to form a party.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: ...Where're they going?</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: Can I go too?</li>
<li><b>Aeris</b>: I wonder what he wants to show Red XIII...?</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Does he want to show him THAT? You know, maybe there's some Materia that's been passed on for generations in this Canyon!?</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Dangerous? Count me out......</li></ul>

Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: What are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that! You want an old man like me should go first? I'll be right behind you.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Just a minute".)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon attempting to leave the Sealed Cave.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: What is it, you're going back? I'll be waiting here for you when you're ready. I can't leave this door open forever.
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the first hole in the Cave of the Gi.)<br />

<b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe. Killed in a certain battle.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: A certain battle...?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't return to the Lifestream...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo.
</p><p>(Upon proceeding to the third screen of the Cave of the Gi.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon. It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they attacked through here, we wouldn't have stood a chance.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: .......
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Let's move on.
</p><p>(Upon proceeding to the fourth screen of the Cave of the Gi.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: This warrior went through the cave all alone. Fighting attackers one after another...
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Grandpa...... That warrior...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo... We're almost there.
</p><p>(In the fourth screen.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: What is this......?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Grandpa, is he...!?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: After death... The ghosts of the Gi... Like stagnant air...... This...can't be!!
</p><p>(After defeating Gi Nattak.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: ...Thank you, Cloud. Because of you, we survived. Nanaki, you have grown strong, too.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: ......Oh yeah?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here.
</p><p>(Upon reaching Seto's Wall.)<br />
<b>Red XIII</b>: This is...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: ...The warrior who fought against the Gi. He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon. But he was never able to return to town...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: ...That... That's ......Seto...?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. ...To protect this Canyon. Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to stone...... Even after they all ran away... Seto, continued to protect us. And he continues to protect us, even now.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Even now...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon. That is your father, Seto.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: That......that is Seto? ...!? Did mother know?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo...She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep this cave shut. They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul. They said we should forget about this cave.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: .........
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Cloud... Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Nanaki. I want you to continue your journey with Cloud and the others.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Grandpa!?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Listen, Nanaki. Cloud says they are trying to save the planet. Honestly, I don't think it can be done. For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only going to postpone the inevitable. Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately. I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do, as a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in misery... No matter what happens, isn't it important to try? Am I just wishing against fate?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I am too old to do anything about it... This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo. That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them! For my sake.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Grandpa...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I wanted to show you your real father before you left... I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show you.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Grandpa...don't talk like that. I don't want to think of life... without you......
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Grandpa! You must live!
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: I'll see to it. I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back to tell you.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Nanaki...
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: I am Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto! I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, Grandpa...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: That's...Seto's...... Seto......
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Seto...... Fa...Father...

<li>(If Cloud had never spoken to a mechanic.)<br /><b>Barret</b>: The buggy's fixed, so we can go now.</li></ul>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: Shall we get going?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: So this is it, Red XIII...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times...

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Mmm?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Cloud. Please look after Nanaki.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What happened?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: I think I grew up a little. That's what happened!

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Tell me about this rocket". After this dialogue, the conversation will end.)<br /><b>Cid</b>: Wow! Not bad for a kid. Alright then, I'll explain it to you. You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the meaningless war, right? Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer.<br /><b>Cid</b>: Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine. There was so much excitement about the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger. They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype! Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26. They chose the best pilot in Shinra-- no, in the world--me. I mean, come on.<br /><b>Cid</b>: And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin' well... But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. That's why they became so anal! And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans. After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got my damn hopes up...DAMN THEM!<br /><b>Cid</b>: Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration. Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for them! Look at this rusted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man in space with this. Everyday, it tilts a little bit more. At this rate, I don't know which will come first, this thing falling down or me gettin' outta here. My last hope is to talk to the President......</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Is Rufus coming?".)<br /><b>Cid</b>: Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program. A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, too!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco"?".)<br /><b>Cid</b>: You out of your *&amp;$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished possession. I can't let you take it.</li></ul>

<li><b>Aeris</b>: Is it like this all the time? You keep quiet even when he's like that to you?</li>

</p><p><b>Shera (in flashback)</b>: I'm...I'm sorry.
</p><p><b>Cid (in flashback)</b>: Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank! Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good, no matter how many times you check that oxygen tank. That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over.
</p><p><b>Shera (in flashback)</b>: But...

</p><p><b>Shera (in flashback)</b>: I don't mind. If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost done.
</p><p><b>Cid (in flashback)</b>: Almost done!? You're gonna die!
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Cid, we must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't!

</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco. We're going after Sephiroth. But seems like we've been going in the wrong direction. But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane...
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: &amp;^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco. Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!?
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Oh my... You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were able to fly in the first place.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: What!?
</p><p><b>Shera</b>: Uh, excuse me... This way...

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Really!?...Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?

</p><p>(Upon talking to the man on the path to the pagoda after teaming up with the Turks.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to the child near the save point after teaming up with the Turks.)<br />

</p><p><b>Reno</b>: All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up. Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...? 1. Because we were ready to die 2. Because we were sure of victory 3. Because we were clueless
</p><p><b>Corneo</b>: Two...Number two?
</p><p><b>Reno</b>: All wrong.

</p><p><b>Godo</b>: Yuffie!!
</p><p><b>Godo</b>: Forgive me... It's all my fault...
</p><p><b>Gorky</b>: What are you saying, Lord Godo!
</p><p><b>Godo</b>: Losing the war...turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...
</p><p><b>Chekhov</b>: Lord Godo!
</p><p><b>Godo</b>: Silence!!
</p><p><b>Godo</b>: Yuffie...... I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war. But, after I lost the war, I began to think... Is strength, only for defeating the enemy? ...or just something to show-off to others...? Might begets might. That's the same way as the Shinra...
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: ......
</p><p><b>Godo</b>: I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai. But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai... And now, I realize both are necessary... Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...!
</p><p><b>Staniv</b>: Lord Godo...
</p><p><b>Godo</b>: You there, please take Yuffie with you! I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!

</p><p><b>Weapon seller</b>: But if it's the "Keystone" you're looking for, you're too late. Don't have it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Keystone?
</p><p><b>Weapon seller</b>: What? You didn't come here for that? The "Keystone" is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old temple somewhere. You're not going to believe your ears, But I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The Temple of the Ancients...
</p><p><b>Weapon seller</b>: Kya, hah hah hah... Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend!

That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not be a good idea NOT to sell it to him...<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Who did you sell it to?<br /><b>Weapon seller</b>: The manager of the Gold Saucer... think his name was "Dio".

<li>(Upon selecting "Where is the Temple?")<br /><b>Weapon seller</b>: Come on...it's only a legend.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Aeris...can you feel it too?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: I think so.

</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: So there are at least 13!?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: ...You know...... I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes. But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though... That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.

</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it. All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom...knowledge... I will meld with it all. I will become one with it... it will become one with me.

</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Soon... we will become one.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: It's simple. Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury. The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet? Think how much energy would be gathered.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me. All that boundless energy will be mine. By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence. Melding with the Planet... I will cease to exist as I am now... Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul.

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: ...It's nothing so don't worry about it.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Right, Cloud! It's nothing.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Sephiroth got away.

<li><b>Vincent</b>: Something huge is falling from the sky?</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky? Hmpf! It's not even an omen.</li></ul>
<p><b>Aeris</b>: ...this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying. The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor. It finds small drifting planets with its magic. And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth!?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha ha ha... It is not me.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Black Materia!!

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: I don't understand......
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: What?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Really!?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What do they mean?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: So, this whole building is the Black Materia?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!? Then no one could take it.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple. And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle. As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too. Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Yes, but there's one thing... You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple. So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I see... the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily...
</p><p>(Depending on the second party member.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: Then just leave it. If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: Let's just leave it, OK?</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: That'll be safer. If no one can else take it...... Then Sephiroth can't either, right?</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: The Ancients were a mean bunch. This way, no one'll be able to get it.</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: I guess that means it's safe here.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?</li></ul>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: No. We've got to think of a way to get it out. Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies. It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia. This place isn't safe.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: So what are we going to do?
</p>
<ul><li>(If Cait Sith is in the party.)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: I heard your situation!</li>
<li>(If Cait Sith is not in the party.)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: Hi, Cloud. This is Cait Sith. I overheard the whole story!</li></ul>
<p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Don't forget about me. Everything you said makes perfect sense! You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia. And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
</p>
<ul><li>(If Cait Sith is in the party.)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: So that means you don't trust me?</li></ul>
<p><b>Cait Sith</b>: But Cloud. There's really nothing else you can do. Everyone, please trust me.
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "I guess we have no choice".)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: All righty then! Leave it all to me!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "No way".)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: You sure are stubborn, Cloud.<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: Please believe me, Cloud.
<ul><li>("Hmmm, I guess I have to")</li>
<li>("How can I?")</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>(After the above dialogue.)

<ul><li>(If Cait Sith is in the party.)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: Everyone, hurry up and get outside! I'll go with you to a safe place.</li>
<li>(If Cait Sith is not in the party.)<br /><b>Cait Sith</b>: Please hurry, you've got to get out of here! I'll be waiting at the exit!</li></ul>
<p>(Upon examining the door found on the path back through the 12 o'clock exit at the Time Guardian.)<br />

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Cloud... ...behind you.
</p><p>(After defeating Demons Gate.)

</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Cait Sith...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Come on, Cloud... Say something.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm not good at this.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Why don't you read our fortunes?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Say, that's right... I haven't done it in a while, huh? I'm so exited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me Now, what should I predict?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Here I go!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: This isn't good. I can't say it. Poor Tifa.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: No! Tell me! I promise I won't get mad!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Is that so? Then I'll tell you. Looks good. You are perfect for each other! Aeris's star and Cloud's star! They show a great future! Cloud, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher... I'll do whatever you want me to! You just call me when it all happens!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy. This is the final, final farewell!
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Be strong Cait Sith!!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel so happy.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Owwww......
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: What happened?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: I can still move more.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: This must be it!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: The Ancients sure did a great job making this.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed... There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's only one me!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Don't forget me even if another Cait Sith comes along.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet...
</p><p>(Outside the temple.)<br />

<li><b>Cid</b>: I'm gonna have a smoke out here! Ahhh!! It's really something, having a smoke at a place like this.</li></ul>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor.
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Got Key Item "Black Materia!"
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Mmm? Can you guys use it?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You mean lots of Spiritual energy?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: That's right. One person's power alone won't do it. Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy... Oh yeah! The Promised Land!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The Promised Land!! No, but...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...Ah, but I have.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: I'm far superior to the Ancients. I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients. I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients. And soon, I will create the future.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: I won't let you do it! The future is not only yours!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha...I wonder?

<b>Aeris</b>: Cloud, can you hear me?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Don't worry about it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...I can't help it...
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: Oh... Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it? And let me handle Sephiroth. And Cloud, you take care of yourself. So you don't have a breakdown,okay?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What is this place?
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: This forest leads to the City of the Ancients... and is called the Sleeping Forest. It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor. That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it.
</p><p><b>Aeris</b>: The secret is just up here. At least it should be. ...I feel it. It feels like I'm being led by something.  Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Aeris?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Hmm...... She's thinking of interfering? She will be a difficult one, don't you think?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: We must stop that girl soon.

<li>(Upon selecting "Don't really know".)<br /><b>Barret</b>: I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it.</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: You know, Cloud. Aeris is gone.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Everyone's out looking for Aeris.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......City of the Ancients. Aeris is headed there.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Hey, we're goin' too.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Only the Ancients, only Aeris can save us from Meteor...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aeris? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth...already knows.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Let's go, Cloud.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No. I might lose it again. If Sephiroth comes near me I might......
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: My fault?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No... I'm afraid. If this keeps up, I may go crazy! I'm afraid...

</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: I see you finally understand.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, right? But...even making me see those things won't affect me. I remember it all. The heat of the fire...the pain in my body... and in my heart!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Oh, is that so? You are just a puppet... You have no heart...and cannot feel any pain... How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being? What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is the illusion.
</p><p>(Upon talking to another party member.)<br />
<b>Party member</b>: Cloud...
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: ...Do you understand?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I don't want to understand. But, I want to ask you one thing. Why...why are you doing this?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha...... I want to take you back to your real self. The one who gave me the Black Materia that day... Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful? Hojo would die if he knew.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Five years ago you were... ...constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt. A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of the Mako. An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. ...That is your reality.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Sephiroth again.)<br />
<b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha......
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud... Don't listen to him... Close your ears! Close your eyes!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What's wrong, Tifa? I'm not affected by it. ...I wasn't paying attention to him.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie. Don't we have our memories together? Being kids together, starlit nights...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha...Tifa... Why are you so worried and scared by those words? Hmm...Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha... You look like you're not feeling well.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Tifa? Is Sephiroth right?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa again.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Cloud...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right. No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that Sephiroth says.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am. There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: But, Tifa...... But you said, 'Long time no see, Cloud' right? Those words will always support me. I am the one you grew up with. I'm Cloud of Nibelheim. No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That's why you shouldn't be so scared. No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your attitude that counts...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No, that's not true, Cloud......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What's not? Aren't I the same Cloud you grew up with?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's not what I mean... I don't know how to say it... Cloud, I need some time... Just give me a little time...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Cloud... Don't blame Tifa. The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the power of Jenova. Inside of you, Jenova has merged with Tifa's memories, creating you. Out of Tifa's memory...... A boy named Cloud might've just been a part of them.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud... Please...don't think right now.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Ha, ha, ha...... Think, Cloud! ...Cloud? Ha, ha, ha......Oh, excuse me. You never had a name...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Shut up...Sephiroth.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: You still don't understand? Then... Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for Mt. Nibel?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ...Tifa, you remember, right? But there is no way he would know. Now...what happened to that picture?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: ......is this it? ...Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud...don't...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I...should be in the picture. Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory world Sephiroth made up.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Just as I thought. This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory. ...Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the reactor. I was sixteen. The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do...? Oh yeah...

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...SOLDIER, First Class?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER? How did I join SOLDIER? Why...why can't I remember?

</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: It's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's moving!
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Weapon... Then it really does exist... I didn't believe in it.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: What does this mean?
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: ...Weapon. Monsters created by the Planet. It appears when the Planet is in danger, reducing everything to nothingness. That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: I never saw that report... Where is it?
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Here, right here.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: You keep a lot of things to yourself.

</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Hey!!! Where did you come from?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...don't know...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: This place is going to get rough. Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still can!!
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Leave things to you? Hmph...I don't know what you mean.

<p><b>Tifa</b>: No, don't!!! Please! Stop Cloud!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Thanks. ......leave the rest to me
</p><p><b>On-screen (red)</b>: Come on. The Black Materia...
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Please wait! Just a little longer!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Everyone, thanks for everything. And...I'm sorry.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Sorry.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Sorry.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Especially you, Tifa. I'm really sorry. You've been so good to me...... I don't know what to say...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I never lived up to being 'Cloud'. Tifa...... Maybe one day you'll meet the real 'Cloud'.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Ha,ha,ha... this is perfect!!! It means that my experiment was a complete success.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: What number were you? Huh? Where is your tattoo?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Professor Hojo... I don't have a number. You didn't give me one because you said I was a failed experiment.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Professor...please give me a number. Please, Professor...
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Shut up, miserable failure...
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Who...was that?
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: ...He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth died five years ago. Jenova cells and Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been combined with science and nature to bring him to life.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: ...I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion Theory has now been proven.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.  I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the Clones have begun to return.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored. But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing. Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream; he wants to manipulate the Clones himself.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yes, that was how it got started.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to figure it out.
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: I couldn't figure it out, either.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their final destination.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth. I was being summoned by Sephiroth. All the anger and hatred I bore him, made it impossible for me to ever forget him. That and what he gave me.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I brought you the Black Materia.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Show yourself to me. Where are you?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sephiroth... So we finally meet again.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will! They won't be diffused into the Lifestream, but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, don't you? Cloud has the Black Materia! Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is going to die!
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Whatever I say now is too little... too late......We must evacuate.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: I want you all to come with me. There is still much more I want to hear.
</p><p>(Depending on who had Black Materia.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: Yo! Cloud! Stop! Knock it off!</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Cloud, NO! Stop! Please!</li></ul>

<p>(During Tifa's dream.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Cloud...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......I didn't know what to do. I was always like that...
</p><p>(During Tifa's flashback in the Sector 7 station.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: What's the matter?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ohhh...
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: ......poor kid.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Ooouugh......
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Are you all right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: oo...uh...agh
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Uh...uh...Tifa...?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa...?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa!
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: ...............?
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Oh, Cloud!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That's right. I'm Cloud.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: Is it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, it's been a while.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: What happened to you? You don't look well.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: How long has it been?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Five years.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: ............
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What is it?
</p><p><b>Tifa (in flashback)</b>: ...it's really been a long time.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Actually, it's been seven years. You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth incident, and now you're a  mercenary...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You told me a lot about what happened after you left Nibelheim... But... ...Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about the things you talked about. All the things you didn't know that you should, And other things you shouldn't know that you did... I wanted to make sure...  But then I heard...you were going far away... 
</p><p>(After flashback, still during dream.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: And I didn't want that... ...I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time.  And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to be with you, watch you.
</p><p>(After Tifa's dream, in Junon.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: ...ding......
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Huh?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: The glare...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You'll be better soon. You've been asleep for a long time.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm......hungry...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Hey, why don't you ask?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: About him.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...Because I'm scared.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry... None of them know if he's all right either.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: He's still...alive, right?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: How long...was I asleep?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What about Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave? Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of light. Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by the barrier. We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: An' on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a rampage.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...Weapon?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Remember that huge monster that was with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater? Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Weapon...is protecting Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up. Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got guts.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no time...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Time...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ... Hey! How about Meteor?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Barret.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Do we have to give up?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...Dunno.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: I thought Cloud would show up to save you all... Professor Hojo wanted to check up on Cloud, too.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What are you going to do to Cloud?
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Sephiroth's alter ego...
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Meteor has been summoned... Essentially, it's all but over now. So, there's no need for you now.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: No, maybe there is an important task for you...
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: President! Preparations for the public execution are complete.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Execution!? What're ya gonna get by executin' us?
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: You are to be executed for causing this situation. People are ignorant. They'll feel better as long as someone is punished.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Well, enjoy your last moments together.
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: I'll tie your arms now.
</p><p>(Upon talking to soldiers on the path while following Tifa.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: You can't pass.
</p><p>(Upon reaching the press room.)<br />
<b>Scarlet</b>: Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness into the world!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: The hell are these people?
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national television.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately need to rally public support... it's better that we punish somebody, anybody.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You make me sick...
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Ha, ha, ha, ha&#160;! They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: We'll start with this girl.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: If you've gotta do it...do me first!
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Camera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats up tearful goodbyes!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What are you doing!?
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: This is my special gas chamber. Take your time, and enjoy a slow painful death.
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Stuck up ^%$#&amp;!!
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Well now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha&#160;!
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Emergency! Emergency!
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Weapon's approaching! Attention all military personnel: take your positions!

</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Damn! Why now?

</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides... I hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help Tifa.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: I'll keep watch at the entrance.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Scarlet.)<br />
<b>Scarlet</b>: ......Fools...... I've already pushed... the switch...
</p><p>(Upon repeated attempts to open the door.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: It won't open!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: It's Weapon.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: I believe so. Your orders?
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: No need to ask.
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: We'll give it a shot from our big cannon.
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!!
<b>NPC</b>: Preparations complete!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: The cannon...
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Fire----!!!
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Did we get 'em?
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Seems so...
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Weapon approaching!
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Speed, 50 Knots!
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: It's heading right toward us!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: It can't be! We hit it dead on!
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: How about the cannon?
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: It'll take time to reload.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Then use regular fire power in the mean time!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Yes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it land!
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Speed, 70 Knots!
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Weapon, closing in!!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>:  Not good! It's attacking!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Gas!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret, help!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Come on! I can't hold on forever!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Shi-!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Cait Sith.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this room first.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!
</p><p>(Upon leaving the press room.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: No! They locked this too!
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Fools. Now, you can't save the girl.
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Ha, ha, ha, ha&#160;!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Goddammit......!!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance.

<p><b>Barret</b>: You okay?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: My cheeks hurt a bit.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Forget about that, what's all this about?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Well, I'll catch the details later. In any case, the Airship, Highwind, is now yours.
</p><p>(Upon reaching the walkway to the cockpit.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Dammit! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship!?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I thought...... Tifa was gone for good.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Come on! Everyone is waiting!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Everyone? Everyone's here?
</p><p>(Upon reaching the cockpit.)<br />
<b>Cid</b>: Welcome to my airship-the Highwind!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Cid......
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Yeah......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>:  Not enough crew.
</p><p>(Upon talking to party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: What's that sad face for?</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Tifa, I'll give you information Shinra. Ask me if there's anything you don't understand.</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: ......So glad you're all right Tifa.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Well, it takes all kinds.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the crew member on the right.)<br />
<b>Pilot in training (LV3)</b>: Yaaaaahh! Don't talk to me right now!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the first crew member on the left.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>:  Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things up!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the second crew member on the left.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Red XIII.)<br />
<b>Red XIII</b>: Do you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud? Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage...... At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No idea at all......
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this! No way we can get offa this train we're on!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud would...... Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do. He'd say, 'Everything's under control, Tifa.'
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm sorry Barret. I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: And Tifa......the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was because......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......I know. That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again.
</p><p>(Upon talking to party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?...... We did fine without him in the beginning...... Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to?</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Cheer up, Tifa......</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Cid.)<br />
<b>Cid</b>: I want you to know that I didn't dislike him.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Gotta admit he was a strange dude. Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn fool thing. And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Everything about him from his movements to his speech were kinda odd. Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way. Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again someday, so cheer up, sis.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......I'll be able to see him someday.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in no time.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: ......Maybe
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Cloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground cracked and swallowed him up...... Buried in the depths of the underground......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Deep within the earth......are you talking about the Lifestream?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: The Lifestream sometimes gushes out to the surface from cracks in the ocean floor. I heard that such a place exists. Maybe, just maybe Cloud's......
</p><p>(Upon talking to the crew member on the right.)<br />
<b>Pilot in training (LV3)</b>: Waaaaah! Captain Cid!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Tifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the ship. Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Oh, and Tifa...... No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared. Go to your room and get ready for our operation.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Cid.)<br />
<b>Cid</b>: I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so put them in order.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Yuffie in the cabin.)<br />
<b>Yuffie</b>: Ha! Ha! ......urk!
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Well......I'm glad you're safe.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: I'm going to stay up here a little longer.
</p><p>(Upon talking to her again.)<br />
<b>Yuffie</b>: ......Urk!......I can't ride ships either in the air or water.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man in the operation room.)
</p>
<ul><li>(Before talking to the pilot.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Sorry!! Go speak to Captain Cid!</li>
<li>(After first talking to the pilot.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Tifa, thank you for a job well done!</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to party members in the cockpit.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: Whenever I think of Cloud, everything gets all jumbled up. No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans. But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us...... Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do......</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: There appears to be a small island near the Lifestream...... They said the Lifestream sometimes suddenly gushes out at the south island. I remember hearing about this from Seto when I was a child, but I don't remember much else...... I'm sorry......Tifa.</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Everything appears calm right now at Shinra. So now's the time to look for Cloud. I'm worried about him, too. I wonder where Cloud is. Or could he already be......</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: Too much hope is the opposite of despair. An overpowering love may consume you in the end......</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: OK! You just signal when you're ready to fly full speed.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the crew member on the right.)<br />
<b>Pilot in training (LV4)</b>: Eagggghh! Are we going?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "We're going".)<br /><b>Pilot in training (LV4)</b>: Eagggggh! We're off!<br />(Control airship.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "We're staying put", conversation ends.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon reaching the dog in the upper part of Mideel.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: What's the matter? Are you all alone?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? Silly thing... 
</p><p><b>NPC (1)</b>:  ......guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here on the shore... Poor pokey-headed young thing...
</p><p><b>NPC (2)</b>: It was really sad......but weird. He was holding this really long sword. I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing thing was those weird blue eyes......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Wha!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Wh......wait a minute!! What did you just say!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Excuse me! That young person you were just talking about......
</p><p><b>NPC (1)</b>: Yeah...a villager found him a little ways down the coast... It was about a week ago I think.
</p><p><b>NPC (2)</b>: Yeah, poor kid...... He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far away...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!!
</p><p>(Depending on party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: You sure!?</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Over here!</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Heh, good job, Tifa.</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: BINGO!!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Jackpot!</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: You've found him.</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now......?
</p><p><b>NPC (1)</b>: Yeah...up ahead here... At the, uh, clinic.......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: He's alive...! Cloud...... Cloud's alive!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud......!!
</p><p>(Depending on party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: Uh......!? Yo, Tifa!!</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Halt!</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Oh, HEY!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Wait up!</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud!?
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: Here now. The way you're running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care of here......
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: A friend...?
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: Oh yeah......! That young fellow!? Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his condition is...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Here?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Over here.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud...!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Oh...Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud......?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Uh......aaa......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Wh......what's wrong...... Cloud......?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: A...... Gurk......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud! What happened to you......!?
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: Mako poisoning...... Quite an advanced case...... It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako energy for a protracted period of time. He probably has no idea who or where he is now...... Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles away from us. Some place far away where no one's ever been... All alone......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Doctor......!!
</p><p>(Depending on party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: That's bad......</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: How horrible......</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Damn......that's evil.</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: You lyin' or what!?</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: That's terrible......</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: .........</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud.......
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: Ahem! Let us excuse ourselves.
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: Listen, would you all mind...... waiting outside?
</p>
<ul><li>(If Barret is in the party.)<br /><b>Barret</b>: .......</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: Why......? What do you want me to do?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Please, Cloud...... Talk to me....... Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, please......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I came this far believing in the memories we have together... This isn't happening......! This is too cruel......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Oh, Cloud......! I.........
</p><p>(Depending on the first party member in the list below.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: So what about him? You know......Cloud?</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Listen Doc, why don't you tell us the truth. What about Cloud? Is he all right?</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Tell me doctor, is Cloud all right? I mean will he heal?</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Hey doctor, is Cloud all right? Is he gonna get better? Come on, tell us the truth</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Hey doc, is he okay? Is he gonna heal?</li></ul>
<p><b>Doctor</b>: I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a case this bad... An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his brain all at once...... No normal human could have survived it......It's a miracle he did!
</p><p>(Depending on the first party member in the list below.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: No wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here......</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: No wonder...... After all he fell into the Lifestream and was carried down here.</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: No wonder. He fell into the Lifestream and was washed up here......</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: No wonder. After falling into the Lifestream......</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: No lie. After fallin' head first into the Lifestream.</li></ul>
<p><b>Doctor</b>: But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere. Listen, if you give up hope... What will happen to him?
</p><p>(Depending on the first party member in the list below.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: .......hope......<br /><b>Barret</b>: Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back? What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow......<br /><b>Doctor</b>: Is something wrong?<br /><b>Barret</b>: No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: ......... Hope............ I guess that's all that's left for us now......</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Hmm, I know he'll recover! Cloud was a strong member of SOLDIER.</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Yeah! I know Cloud'll get better! With friends like us worrying about him He can't go wrong.</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Yeah, that's right. Besides, WE'RE here for him. He's gotta get better!</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: .........

<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Are you all right, Tifa?</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: You all right?</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: You okay, Tifa?</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: Yes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried. And I have something I want to tell you all......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I don't care about anything else, only Cloud...... I......want to be by his side......
</p><p>(Depending on party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: Yeah, that's probably best...... For Cloud...... an' for you......</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Yes, that's best!</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Yeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa.</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: You gotta do it then. You gotta live true to yourself.</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: If Tifa was my nurse, I'd switch places with Cloud any day!</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: Do what you wish.</li></ul>
<p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this......
</p><p>(Depending on the first party member.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: Why you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: That's all right. We'll be by again.</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: No big, no big. I'll pop in again later.</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: What're you talkin' about? Not even. We'll stop in again.</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: Don't worry. We'll return and check on him later.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Don't worry. I'll stop by again sometime.</li></ul>

<p><b>Barret</b>: What're we gonna do now! What can WE do?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do? An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Oh, I've got some news.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yeah, what!? That you a spy?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Yeah...... I've already told you I was.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Both gya ha ha and Kya ha ha , are up to something. Wanna eavesdrop?
</p><p>(In the Shinra Building conference room.)<br />
<b>Rufus</b>: Now then...... We're faced with two issues. 1 Destroy Meteor. 2 Remove the barrier around North Cave and defeat Sephiroth. Any ideas?
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Gya haah hah hah! We already solved the first problem! Meteor will soon be smashed to bits! The plan has already been put in motion. Namely, to collect Huge Materia from each region.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Well......
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Huge Materia is a high density special type of materia made through a special compression process in Mako reactors. The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal materia. Ha, ha, ha! How about that!? We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into Meteor. That will cause a huge explosion!! Reducing Meteor literally to bits.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: You're going to ram Meteor? Do you think we have the technology to do it?
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Don't worry about that! More importantly, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area.
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: We've already collected materia from Nibelheim. All that's left is "Corel" and "Fort Condor". I've already dispatched troops to Corel. Ghaa haah hah hah!
</p><p>(In the <i>Highwind</i>.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Corel! What else can they do to Corel!?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: And the Huge Materia...... You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it. When, our small materia nears the larger one, something should happen. I'm certain of it. That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight......
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked.
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: So, what are you saying, Barret? Even though you're always knocking him, you really want Cloud to return.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just...shut your face!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Every group's gotta have a leader. An' that's me! Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader. I never knew that till lately.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: An' that's what is......
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: ......ZZZZ......hmph?

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You been chosen to be the new leader.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Pain in the ass. Forget it.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you. We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You! That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Hm......this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna be just a little tough?
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Oh man, that went straight to my heart. I'm a man, too! Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!

</p><p><b>Cid</b>: There's no time, hurry!!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Tifa!! Cloud!! Get outta here!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: This is bad...... The tremors are getting worse.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Wait a minute, Cloud.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay here...?
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: Hmm...... It might be safer to take refuge in a wide open space.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Don't you worry about a thing, Cloud...... I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!
</p><p><b>Doctor</b>: No! The structure can't take it!! Hurry!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yes!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Ready Cloud? We're leaving now!!
</p><p>(After FMV.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Wh,where am I......? what's happening? I......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Where's Cloud......!? Cloud,where are you!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Huh......what......? Who......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Who is it......? I can't hear......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Wait a minute......! I don't know anything about that!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No! It's not me......! I'd never do anything like that!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No! Stop it......!! Stay back!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Somebody......help! Please!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud,help me!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Eyaaaaghh......!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ............ Where am I......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What is it, Cloud? What is this......!? Is this the inside of your dreams? Or is it...... your......subconsciousness......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You're searching, aren't you Cloud? Searching......for yourself......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you back!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But...... Where do we start......?
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the Cloud on the left side.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: That starry night at the well...... The promise we made that night...... What if that memory was all a lie?
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the Cloud on the bottom right.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: ............a sealed up secret......wish....... Tender feelings....... that no one can ever know......
</p><p>(Upon inspecting Cloud at the top.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: The gates of Nibelheim... Five years ago, Sephiroth passed through these gates...... And...... That's how it all started.......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: It connects....... to Nibelheim......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's right... It's probably best to start from there......
</p><p>(Upon entering the Nibelheim area at the top.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy...... But I'll be right with you......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud...look.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Here's the well...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: And that's Gramps' Inn, too.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: This is the Nibelheim you remember, right? It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this place is......our Nibelheim.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Cloud.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Five Years ago...two men from SOLDIER came... Sephiroth and...... a young and vibrant soldier. Can you tell me again what happened?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in vision)</b>: How does it feel?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Five Years ago...I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in vision)</b>: It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in vision)</b>: So how does it feel?
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown...
</p><p><b>Cloud (in vision)</b>: Ummm...how 'bout your parents?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: So this is...the Great Sephiroth.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in vision)</b>: My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in vision)</b>: What does it matter...?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in vision)</b>: All right, let's go.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I remember, I felt a foreboding about him.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No, Cloud. I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you ...something terrible might happen. But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years ago.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I...waited. But, Cloud...never came. The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in vision)</b>: All right, let's go.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth wasn't......Cloud......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: There's nothing...... I can say...... You must find the answer yourself...... If you can't...... Then you......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Take your time, Cloud. Slowly......little by little, okay?
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the Cloud on the bottom right.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: .......a sealed up secret......wish....... Tender feelings...... that no one can ever know.........
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the Cloud on the left side.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: That starry night at the well...... And our promise that night... What if the memory was just a lie?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Don't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly. Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back...... Slowly......little by little......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Right...like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled with stars......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: From the beginning...OK?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Try and remember, Cloud.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Right, I was wearing these clothes.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's you, too. You were so small then......  ...and cute.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sephiroth once said... Cloud made up his memories by listening to my stories... Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just Cloud and I. We talked at the well... That's why I continued to believe that you were the real Cloud. 
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I still believe you're the Cloud from Nibelheim... But you don't believe in yourself... These memories aren't enough.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud, what about your other memories?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No, not memories. A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, right? That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different thing......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But it's different from a memory locked deep within your heart...... That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me? I say something and you don't remember it...... But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know that's our memory......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place? I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>:  ......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I thought if I got stronger I could get someone to notice......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>:  Someone to notice you...? ......who?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Who......? ......You know who! ......You, that's who.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You.......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ......Me? Why!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa......did you forget...... about those days?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Look......I...... I'm sorry...... But what are you talking about?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No......it's all right. You were having a hard time back then. You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you don't remember me back then.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: 'Back then'?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's important to me...... I hate to say it but... It's a very important memory...... Do you want to see it?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Cloud on the left side.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: A promise under a starry sky... But what if even that was a memory that Tifa imagined......?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Cloud at the top.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth to Nibelheim wasn't Cloud...?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the young Cloud.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Come on, hurry.
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the Cloud on the bottom right.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: ......a sealed up secret......wish...... Tender memories...... no one can ever know.........
</p><p>(Upon talking to the young Cloud.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Do you know where this window goes to, Tifa?  Fine......I'll go.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: My room?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It was my first time there.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Was...it?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I only used to look up at it from outside.
</p><p><b>NPC (in vision)</b>: Hey, look!
</p><p><b>NPC (in vision)</b>: Cloud's coming!
</p><p><b>NPC (in vision)</b>: You think he wants to come in?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Was that the first day you came into my room?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...that's right. We lived next to each other. But I really didn't know you that well.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I've known you since we were children and always thought we were close...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Now that you mention it...I don't recall you ever being in my room...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa always used to be with this three-some.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...That's right.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I used to think...they were all stupid.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But we were children, back then.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...I know. I'm the one that was stupid. I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed into the group.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Then later... I began to think I was different... That I was different from those immature kids. That then...maybe...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>:  Just maybe, they would invite me in. I thought that might happen, so I hung around...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>:  I was so prejudiced. And...weak.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That night I called Tifa out to the well... I thought to myself Tifa would never come...that she hated me.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah...it was so sudden. I was...a bit surprised.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But... It's true that we weren't THAT close, but... After you left town, I really thought about you a lot. I used to wonder how Cloud was doing. I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER? I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an article about you.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Thanks, Tifa. Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: OK!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Huh? What happened on this day? Was it a special day?
This was the day...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa's mother...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: The day Mom died...
</p><p><b>Tifa (in illusion)</b>: I want...to see...mom...
</p><p><b>Tifa (in illusion)</b>: ...I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?
</p><p><b>NPC (1, in illusion)</b>: Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there. 
</p><p><b>NPC (2, in illusion)</b>: No one crosses that mountain alive...
</p><p><b>Tifa (in illusion)</b>: How 'bout those that died? Did mama pass through the mountains?
</p><p><b>Tifa (in illusion)</b>  I'm going!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Cloud silhouette.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: I don't remember the path I walked. Tifa missed her step. I ran to her...but didn't make it in time. Both of us fell off the cliff. Back then, I only scarred my knees but......
</p><p><b>NPC (in illusion)</b>: Cloud! Why'd you bring Tifa to a place like this! What the hell's the matter with you!? What if she dies!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa was in a coma for seven days. We all thought she wouldn't make it. If only I could've saved her... I was so angry... Angry at myself for my weakness.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Ever since then, I felt Tifa blamed me... I got out of control... I'd get into fights not even caring who it was.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth. If I got strong like Sephiroth, then everyone might...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: If I could just get stronger...... Then even Tifa would have to notice me......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: So that was it......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sorry, Cloud. If I had only remembered more clearly what happened, I could have done something sooner......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's not your fault, Tifa.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But, I remember back when we were eight!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's it! Now I know! You weren't created five years ago.
My childhood memories weren't all made up!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Hang in there Cloud! Just a little longer! You've almost found the real you!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Let's go back to Nibelheim again......!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Cloud at the top.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the palm of our hands.
</p><p>(Upon entering the Nibelheim area.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Cloud, wait. Where are you going?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......The reactor......?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: To the reactor! The Mako reactor of five years ago!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Hey! It's Cloud!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Za......ck......Zac......k. Zack...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You remembered!!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Then, where were you, Cloud?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud... Did you...see it all?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I saw...everything...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in illusion)</b>: Aaarrrgh......who...who are you?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in illusion)</b>: Mom... Tifa......my town...give it back...
</p><p><b>Cloud (in illusion)</b>: I had so much respect for you... I admired you...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That's what happened...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...You were there. You were watching me.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah, I remember.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Hmm...so it was you.
</p><p><b>Tifa (in illusion)</b>: Better take real good care of me then!
</p><p><b>Zack (in illusion)</b>: Hey Cloud. If you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask off?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in illusion)</b>: Yeah......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah...this is...me. I...never made it as a member of SOLDIER. I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, but... I was so embarrassed...... I didn't want to see anybody...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in illusion)</b>: How does it feel?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in illusion)</b>: It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud (in illusion)</b>: I'm...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ...You came. ...You kept your promise. So you really did come when I was in trouble!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sorry... I didn't get there...fast enough...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: It's all right...Cloud.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in illusion)</b>: Just like you.
</p><p><b>Zack (in illusion)</b>: Cloud... Kill Sephiroth...
</p><p><b>Cloud (in illusion)</b>: Sephiroth!!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in illusion)</b>: Don't...push...your luck...
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (in illusion)</b>: ...It can't be!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Then...this is goodbye, Tifa. Until we meet again......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: ............!?
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the shadow at the center.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Cloud!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Uh...... Ah, Uh.......!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Uh...... Tifa......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Oh, Cloud......! It's really you, isn't it?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah...... Tifa...... We finally......meet again......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Krgh......!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud!? Are you all right!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: V, voice...... Their......
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I see. We're... in the Lifestream aren't we?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Everyone's waiting. Let's go back, Cloud. Back to everyone......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, I guess so... Come on, Tifa. Let's go home......
</p><p>(In Mideel.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Yo! You awright!? Tifa!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: u...unn......?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret... You came back. I...... Cloud... Where is he?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Don't worry about him. He's a tough one.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret......I...... When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real Cloud. I mean, I didn't really find him. Cloud found himself on his own...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Awright, I know... I shouldn't have doubted him. But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: People have so many things pent up inside of themselves... And they can forget so many things...... Strange......isn't it....... .........
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yo, Tifa! Snap outta it!!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Tifa......!?
</p><p>(In the <i>Highwind</i> operations room.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Everyone......I'm sorry. I don't know what to say......
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Don't say anything, Cloud. All you've been doing is apologizing.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I never was in SOLDIER. I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, about being in SOLDIER. I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to SOLDIER...... I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from my friend Zack... And I created an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life...... And I continued to play the charade as if it were true.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm physically built like someone in SOLDIER. Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult. It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy. Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER. It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion. But weak people......like me, get lost in the whole thing.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me. Everyone knew that. I'm......Cloud.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......the master of my own illusionary world. But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more...... I'm going to live my life without pretending.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You're sure messed up, Cloud!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: That means there ain't no difference from before!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: By the way, Cloud. What are you going to do now? Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us. That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this thing.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's like you always told me, Barret.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Oh, uh, you mean that!
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: What? I don't understand!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: The train we on don't make no stops!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Let's do it, Cloud!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the crew member in the room.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Oh......oh...... Cloud......
</p><p>(Upon leaving the room room.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Cloud, I was deeply moved by your story! I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you feel, Cloud! No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!
</p><p>(After selecting party members.)
<b>Cait Sith</b>: Listen, Cloud. We're right in the middle of the mission for the Huge Materia, right?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: I know this's kinda outta the blue, but there's a underwater reactor at Junon. As far as I can see, that's the only one left. That's that. Let's go!
</p><p>(Upon talking to party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Tifa</b>: Let's do our best, Cloud!</li>
<li><b>Barret</b>: C'mon, Cloud! Don't #&amp;$* around! We're goin' to Junon, boyeee!!</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: I'm glad you're back with us!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: This's kinda on the spur o' the moment, but shouldn't we oughta get to Junon!?</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: Escape from a world of illusions... Hmph...I wonder which is better...?</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one. I always forget who has what materia.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Yuffie in the cabin, the first time.)<br />
<b>Yuffie</b>: Huh? How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is...getting sick on boats and rides...... So, please......just leave me alone.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......I really do understand, Yuffie. When I get sick on a flight, it's a real killer. When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion sickness.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Oh...... Isn't there any way to prevent this?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Well, according to my research...... First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick. But you can't always be nervous.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: With this much space, your best bet is to move around while you're riding. It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks. That sucked!...... And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding. And that is......
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Read!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do. I know it's tough......
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: ......so you're a little better off than me. But I don't feel......well.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: ......Urk...... ......I'm not down yet.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Yuffie any subsequent time.)<br />
<b>Yuffie</b>: Where's the next stop? Can't you get there any quicker? Cloud, put me in your party, so I can get off this ship.

</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?
</p><p><b>NPC (2)</b>: We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor.
</p><p><b>NPC (1)</b>: Our rocket's gonna save the planet!

</p><p><b>NPC (3)</b>: We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most important device is broken.

</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Oh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 100 years!

</p><p><b>NPC</b>: All right, Captain. Good luck.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hey, Cid! What're you doing!?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the Materia. We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from Sephiroth. There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You understand that, right?
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I also understand what you're thinking. But listen. I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: No, I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the power of science. Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to fly now! And finally, we're about to go into outer space.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Science is a "Power" created and developed by humans. And science just might be what saves this planet. I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, there's nothing greater!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do! I don't want to regret not having done something later.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: But, Cid......

</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Goddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast!

<li><b>Vincent</b>: We're in space now. A long rest...</li></ul>
<p><b>Cid</b>: That damn Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. We might not be able to change the course.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...this is the end?
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you give up that easily?
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: I'm not gonna crash into Meteor.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Just watch.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like this.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right before we crash into Meteor.

<li><b>Tifa</b>: Hey, what about the Huge Materia?</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: But, what are we going to do with the Huge Materia? Are we just going to give it up?</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: Hmm? What are we gonna do with the Huge Materia? If you don't want it, maybe... you could ...give it to ME!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: By the way, what are we goin' to do with the Huge Materia?</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: Then the remaining question is what to do with the Huge Materia.</li></ul>
<p><b>Cid</b>: ......
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: If you want the Materia, do whatever you want! The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...You sure?
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: I dunno... I know what I said a minute ago. But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer space. So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You're pretty damn optimistic&#160;! You up to somethin'?
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that. All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet. I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that escape pod.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I've...been thinking too. About the universe...planet...ocean. How wide and big... No matter where I go and what I do it won't change a thing.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Maybe you're right. But I came up with something different. I always thought this planet was so huge. But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, that's why we came.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each have to take a good long look at ourselves. There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts. Something buried, or something forgotten. Remember it... Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are all looking for...

<li><b>Tifa</b>: ...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come.</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: nghh...no good. We alone cannot do it. We need to have the others here.</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: You expect me to know that? Let the others do it!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: How about it, Cloud? Shouldn't we have the others come?</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: I don't know, Cloud. I think we should have everyone here.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Ahh, no good. Cloud you call the others in here too!</li></ul>
<p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing.
</p>
<ul><li>(If Yuffie was recruited.)<br /><b>Yuffie</b>: Me either! I don't get any of this!</li></ul>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: I remember Aeris a lot. No...not that. You haven't remembered. You haven't forgotten. That's not it... How would you say it... Aeris was right there all along. Right by our side. She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aeris did... The words she left behind...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: That reminds me... I was the same.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: ......as was I.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Me too...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: She said she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's Meteor.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But Aeris is gone.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Is it impossible for us to carry on... what Aeris tried to accomplish?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: What, did that girl go off to that place?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That's it!!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: What's it?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We don't know about it. What did Aeris know? Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: I see... She returned there once again, correct?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: You're going too?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: What's so surprising about that...? Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages.
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling...right.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go.
</p>
<ul><li>(If the player has at least one Huge Materia.)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you. We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place...<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our way?<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: 'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You just pull this here...<br />(On the hologram machine.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia...? This is really rare Materia, indeed. Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness enclosed in it.<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave. Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever want to see Materia, come here anytime.</li></ul>
<p>(In the <i>Highwind</i>.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: Hm, hmm, hmm!......
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Smells like machinery. I love this smell.
Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too......
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Hm? Is the deck up there?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time. I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind. I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in the smell of machinery... Well, bye for now.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Bugenhagen on the deck again.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: I wonder where you're taking me?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Tifa.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: I wonder what Aeris felt... when she was on that altar...?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all. I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along. She always used to talk about the 'Next time'. She talked about the future more than any of us...
</p><p>(Upon talking to her again.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Although she never talked about it to us she must've had a rough life... I think Aeris looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone... ...she must've had many many dreams......
</p><p>(Upon talking to party members.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Yuffie</b>: Cloud......urp......ugh. You know, I was thinking......phew...... Why does materia always have something to do with battles or magic? I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting. It must've been...ugh... terrible...</li>
<li><b>Barret</b>: And Aeris...she's dead. Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the planet, huh? But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again...</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: Aeris used to pat me on the nose sometimes. I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also liked the attention. I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met.</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: I went an'told Aeris' Mom about her death. Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly... So was little Marlene...</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: City of the Ancients... The Ancients...after a long time that is probably what others will come to call us... Hmm...hwa ha ha ha... It's only a matter of time for us.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Aeris...? I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind......</li></ul>

<p><b>On-screen</b>: Received Key Item "Key to Ancients"!
</p><p>(Upon reaching the crystal in the Forgotten City.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: This is...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Yes......exactly...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Are you getting something?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: ...give me a moment.
</p><p>(Upon approaching Bugenhagen.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: The knowledge of the Ancients swirling around here is telling me one thing. The planet's in a crisis... A crisis beyond human power or endless time. It says, when the time comes, we must search for 'Holy'.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Holy?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Holy...the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor. If a soul seeking Holy reaches the planet, it will appear. Ho Ho Hooo. Meteor, Weapon, everything will disappear. Perhaps, even ourselves.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Even us!?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: It is up to the planet to decide. What is best for the planet. What is bad for the planet. All that is bad will disappear. That is all.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hooo. I wonder which we humans are?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Search for Holy... How do we do it?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Speak to the planet. Get the White Materia... This will bond the Planet to humans. Then speak to the planet. If our wish reaches the planet, the White Materia will begin to glow a pale green.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...This is the end. Aeris had the White Materia... But when Aeris died, it fell from the altar... That's why......this is the end.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hooo!
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hooo!
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hooo! Look at this!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>:&#160;!?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ancients' writing.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Can you read it?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I can't even make it out!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: This's no time for jokes...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I'm not an Ancient. I can't read this thing!
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I may be old, but my eyes aren't completely bad yet. Look closely below the writing.
</p>
<ul><li>(If the player does not have the Key to Ancients.)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: There's something written in chalk... ......(even sunlight can't reach)......(Key)</li>
<li>(If the player has the Key to Ancients.)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: There's a note written in chalk... ...(key)...(in the Music Box)</li></ul>
<p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: It was probably written by a scientist who's been here... He probably used all his energy to make out these two words.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Key......? To what?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I don't know... But, it probably has something to do with our riddle. The riddle...then it must have something to do with Aeris.
</p><p>(If the player has the kay.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: What does it mean?
</p><p><br />
</p>
<dl><dt>(If the player did not obtain the Key to Ancients earlier.)</dt></dl>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: So this note points to where the key is?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Probably... Use these words as clues and go find the key. I'll continue to figure out the Ancients' writing.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: A place (Even sunlight won't reach) is where the (key) is, right?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: When you find the key, or when you can't go any further, come back here. Maybe I'll understand more from the writing and get some new information for you.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Bugenhagen without the Key to Ancients.)
</p>
<ul><li>(Initially..)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Remember, a place (even sunlight can't reach) is where the (key) is...</li>
<li>(After returning to the area twice.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: (even sunlight can't reach)... Hmm...if we're above ground, and sunlight reaches everywhere... Then it's probably not above ground...</li>
<li>(After returning to the area five times.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: A place where sunlight doesn't reach... Right, it must be underwater!<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Underwater? There's...no way... We need a submarine...<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Wait. Submarine...I think there's one at Junon Port......</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to party members in the <i>Highwind</i> during the Key to Ancients search.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Yuffie</b>: Are you waiting for Cloud? He's flying right now, so you can't get him. Were you going to force me into the submarine right now? Quit it! If you want to go, then just leave me behind. ............ooooooh. What're you talking about? I......</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud......</li>
<li><b>Barret</b>: Whacha gonna do, Cloud? Got any good ideas?</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: If I were more of an adult...Perhaps, I would have a better idea of what to do? Phew...I wish I could grow up. I wonder if I'll be an adult after all this is over?</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Lately, they don't call me to no more meetin's. Reckon that's because y'all know I'm a spy.</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: ......feelings alone aren't enough. ...it's irritating, isn't it Cloud?</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Phew......Cloud. What're gonna do?</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the pilot.)<br />

</p>

<li>(Upon selecting "Uh, wait a sec!", nothing happens.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Bugenhagen after finding the key.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: Oh! You've found it!
</p>
<dl><dt>(When the player presents Key to Ancients to Bugenhagen. Occurs straight after if the player already had the key, or after returning to Bugenhagen with it.)</dt></dl>
<p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: That Music Box over there. We'll put the key in it.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: I'll go use the key. You all wait here. And watch closely what happens.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hooo!
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Now, go inside. Hope may be inside... Or......
</p><p>(Upon approaching the crystal.)<br />
<b>Bugenhagen</b>: This was just a screen to project an image! Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...It's glowing.
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hooo!! It's pale green!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...Aeris. Aeris has already prayed for Holy. ...After I gave up the Black Materia to Sephiroth...... Aeris' words came into my dreams... She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... And to do that, there was a secret here... That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. Aeris knew about here... and what she had to do. Aeris has left us great hope. But, it cost her her life... her future...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm sorry...Aeris. I should have figured this out sooner.
...You left us without saying a word...... It was all so sudden, so I couldn't think... That's why it took so long for me to find out... But, Aeris...I understand now. Aeris... I'll do the rest.
</p><p>(Depending on the first party member.)
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: That's 'WE'!</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: You mean, WE...</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: WE'LL take care of it.</li>

<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: The thing Aeris left for us... We gotta take care of it.</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: What Aeris left us... We can't waste it.</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b>: What Aeris left for us... We can't let it go to waste.</li>
<li><b>Yuffie</b>: The hope she left us... We've gotta take a chance with it!</li>
<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: What Aeris left us... We mustn't let go to waste...</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: The hope an important person left for us... We must make it stronger...</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: The big gift the flower girl left for us... It'd be sad if we didn't finish it!</li></ul>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: Thank you...Aeris.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Aeris' voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the glow of the White Materia. But......how about Holy? How come Holy isn't moving? Why?
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Something's getting in its way.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ......Him...... He's the only one that could do it. ...Sephiroth. Where are you?

</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: whisper...whisper... (sorry I was a little surprised).
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What happened?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: You remember when the Junon Cannon disappeared? Actually, Rufus moved it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Moved it? That big thing......? Where...? Why?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Rufus wants to destroy Sephiroth with it. That cannon operates on Huge Materia. But the Huge Materia has already been used in the Rocket Plan. So since the cannon's useless right now, he decided to move it. To a place where Materia... no, where Mako is gathered...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: And, where is that!?
</p><p>(In the president's room in the Shinra Building.)<br />

</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: I see......
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Hah, hah, hah! Don't worry about adjusting it, Reeve. Once you open it up all the way everything will go full speed!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Gya hah, hah, hah! The President's sure done it this time! If we can only defeat Sephiroth, the idea that Meteor will also disappear is based on different objectives!
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Please remember, Mr. President... It was my idea to fire Mako reactor powered shells.
</p><p><b>Rufus</b>: Will the shells really reach the far northern border?
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Ah, hah hah! Of course! But Mr. President, please do not call it a Mako cannon. This new weapon will be called...... The Sister Ray!

</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: I been itchin' to say this to ya fer a while now! When ya blew the Midgar No. 1 up, how many folks d'ya think died?

</p><p><b>Cid'</b>: Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Right, sorry about that.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Hold it!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?
</p><p>(In the Shinra Building conference room.)<br />
<b>Heidegger</b>: Strange. I can't reach the President!
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Not the President. To Sister Ray!
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: None of that matters! The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise! It must cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off the machine!
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: We can't do that! It's inoperable!
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation! We can't operate it from here.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: What about the mainframe? Who!?
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Hey, call the mainframe!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Huh? Why are you giving orders?
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: I don't give a damn about the details!!
</p><p>(At the Sister Ray.)<br />
<b>Hojo</b>: Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth. I'll give you all the Mako you want.
</p><p><b>Reeve (on the phone)</b>: Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...it's a small price to pay.
</p><p><b>Reeve (on the phone)</b>: Hojo! HOJO......!!
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Show me......Sephiroth. It should be near... Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science... Before your presence, science is powerless... I hate it, but I'll concede to it. Just...let me see it. Ha, ha, ha......

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Can't you stop the Mako reactor?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: ......We can't stop it.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: ............

</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: I can't make you trust me......
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying? I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves...... But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below. Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until everything blasts out... And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out......
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: An explosion!!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor blew up!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Damn...!
</p><p><b>Cait Sith</b>: Forget about that.........the CANNON! We've got to get to Midgar! That's the first thing!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Must stop Hojo...first.

<b>Reeve</b>: Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the way!
<b>Heidegger</b>: Ghaa haah hah hah! Don't be so ludicrous! I don't recall you giving me any orders! The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the enemy retreat! Because of them, I...... I...!
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: That's a private matter......
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way! Ghaa haah hah hah!

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What I meant was...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that. Save the planet...for the future of the planet... Sure, that's all fine. But really, is that really how it is?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: For me, this is a personal feud. I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past. Saving the planet just happens to be part of that.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I've been thinking.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I think we all are fighting for ourselves. For ourselves...and that someone... something...whatever it is, that's important to us. That's what we're fighting for. That's why we keep up this battle for the planet.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You're right... It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet. But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor...... Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to do things. I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: ...At first, it was revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my town. But now...... Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene. For Marlene... For Marlene's future... Yeah...I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Go and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for yourselves. I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back.
</p><p><b>Cid</b>: Maybe ain't none of us'll come back. Meteor's gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any useless struggling!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I know why I'm fighting. I'm fighting to save the planet, and that's that. But besides that, there's something personal too... A very personal memory that I have. What about you all?  I want all of you to find that something within yourselves. If you don't find it, then that's okay too. You can't fight without a reason, right? So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back.

</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Hmm...But that's all right, even if no one comes back. As long as I'm with you... As long as you're by my side... I won't give up even if I'm scared.

</p><p>(Upon entering the bedroom at the top of the weapons store if the player has not paid for the room.)

<p>(Upon talking to the train conductor.)<br />
<b>Conductor</b>: When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives. People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the conductor again.)<br />
<b>Conductor</b>: I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers. I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the conductor again.)<br />
<b>Conductor</b>: That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again. Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then. But, that's a story for another day...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the conductor again.)<br />

If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust... Well, there's no point in worryin' about that. Hey!! Look! It's huge, ain't it? Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place. This is my place, but you can come here when you want. Bye, bro!

Since today's special, I'm gonna let you in on a juicy bit of news. But you gotta keep it to yourself. Do you know about what's been going on......?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "What, that again?".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: I guess you must be sick of hearing it... But it's been so long since there was any real news here. You're worried where it's all heading, right?</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "............".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Everything's in a buzz 'bout that terrorist group AVALANCHE blowin' up the Sector 1 Mako Reactor. On the surface they say they're an anti-Shinra group, but in reality... They say they're just out to kill as many people as they can. Gyaaaa, Haaa haaa!! That's a good one, ain't it!? While they're bustin' things up on top, the only ones makin' out good are us weapon stores! Now, if we can just get rid of this back stock, we'll be doin' ok.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the boy in the Beginner's Hall.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to the man with black hair.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to the man with black hair again.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to the girl.)<br />

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "No, what?".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: There's a news update. They say that there was a terrorist explosion up above, and that this time it was a Mako Reactor!! You know what this means?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "No, what?".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Ya see, I keep on top of these things, an' if ya ask me...... If you knock out Midgar's power, then all of its computers and signals are going to be knocked out too. Financially there must've been about a billion gil worth of damage. An' that ain't all!! A lotta innocent people got killed too! If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Don't care".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Oh, well excuse ME!</li></ul></li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Don't care".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Oh, well excuse ME!</li></ul>

</p><p>(Upon talking to Johnny.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to the man with black hair.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to the man with black hair again.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Now that you mention it, there used to be an outside TV monitor here in the slums. But that Barret, busted it up. Shot it up with that weird machine gun hand of his. Blam, blam, blam. I think it was when President Shinra was on. He was on again this morning, too, you know. Tifa better watch out for her TV.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the boy.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: All's quiet!! Shh, I'm spying now! OH!! There's something!! DANGER!! ALERT!!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the girl.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Did you hear?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "'Bout what?".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: About that little girl named Tifa and that bar called '7th Heaven'. I'm not only informed, I'm kinda nosey too. Anyhow, I got the scoop. You wanna hear?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "You bet!".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: That Barret and three of his henchmen are like this sometimes. Suddenly, they threw out a customer and start talking trash to him. It's strange, if you ask me. And that place always smells like gun powder. It's dangerous, I tell you. They must be doing terrible things in there.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Don't care".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!</li></ul></li>

[Red triangles] mark the exits and [Green triangles] mark ladders. These will help you safely make it through even the darkest streets or dangerous mountains! But, there are times when it won't appear, so be careful.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man next to the dog in the Beginner's Hall.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: This is the Beginner's Hall. You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you how much I know... an' for free too!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What do you want to know?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "How to save?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Now I'll tell you about saving. You know what'll happen if you don't save? That's right. Everything you worked so hard to do will be lost! You never know when there might be a power outage. And you've got a long battle ahead of you. It pays to save often and take breaks when you need them. Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games. But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any. You'll have to get some at a (real) store. I guess you already have a Memory card. Put the Card firmly into the slot. Put it in either the right or left side. Then when you're ready, access the menu. Select [Save]. Remember you can't just save wherever you want. You can only save at places marked [Save Point]. When you find one, a message will appear. Whenever you reach a [Save Point], you'll want to save your game. Slot 1 is on the left, slot 2 on the right. Choose either one. Next, choose your file and save it. Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files. If you have files from other games on it, there will be less room to save. The screen only shows 3 files at a time so, press the directional buttons to scroll down the list, and you can see the rest. Remember, the more files you have, the longer it will take to load. One last thing. The Memory card is a delicate device. Be careful when handling it. Never remove it while saving or loading. Don't get mad even if you lose. If that happens, just chill out, and let your head, and your console, cool down. That's all. Remember to save often so you don't lose your games.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "How to heal your allies?")
<ul><li>(If the player has no Potions.)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: First, you need Potions.<br /><b>NPC</b>: You're a stingy one. Here, I'll give you ONE Potion.</li>
<li>(If the player has already received a Potion through this dialogue interaction.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: I don't have any extra Potions on me. Why don't you go buy some?</li>
<li>(If the player has at least one Potion.)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: You probably already know this but... HP is your life force. If HP is lost in battle, you're out of commission. MP is the source of your magic power. If your MP's lost, you'll be unable to cast spells. So, what should we do to cure a damaged ally? There are three ways. First, you can rest at an inn at a nearby town. Second, you can use items to help them recover. Third, you can use curative magic. I'll explain about Magic later, but here we'll talk about items. Select [Item] from the menu. Potion restores HP. If you can't find where Potion is, access the menu and select [Arrange] to change the order of items. You can arrange them however you like. Order items you'll use in the field. Order items you'll use in battle. Prioritize items you can throw in battle. Order weapons and armor separately. Order by name Order by most items held Order by least items held By the way, [Key Item]'s are just that, items that unlock problems just like a key. They're very important items to have. Keep that in mind. Ok, now select [Use], Then select [Potion]. Select the person you want to use it on. If they're already maxed out, you won't be able to use it on them. We can restore MP with [Ether]. You use this the same way you did for [Potion]. Just pick a member and use it! The number appearing next to the item name tells you how many are available. Of course, the more you use, the less you'll have. Some enemies will drop Potions or Ethers, but you'll want to stock up whenever you're at a store. One last thing, if someone in your party gets wiped out, either rest at an inn or use [Phoenix Down]. That's all!</li></ul></li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Curative Magic?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Now I'll tell you how to use curative magic. First, access the menu and select [Magic]. Next, select who'll cast the spell. Pick an ally equipped with [Restore] Materia. You can select another party member by using the L1 and R1 buttons. The function also work in other sub menus. Better remember that. This is magic you can use, monsters you can summon, and enemy techniques you've learned. Whenever [Magic] is selected... the available magic appears on the screen... So, if you wanted to use [Cure]... you would select it from the menu... then select who you want to use it on. I think Potion is pretty expensive, so... when you're near an inn and you can restore MP, it's better to use curative magic rather than Potion. That's all.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Weapons and armor?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Equipping weapons &amp; armor is basic to battle. Let me show you how it's done. Just finding or buying new weapons or armor, isn't enough. You have to access the menu and select [Equip]. Then, select who you want to equip. You can change weapons, armor and accessories. Accessories have special effects. Just select what you want to change. On the right side of the screen, here's a list of what can be equipped. You can see the item's effect here. Change your weapon with the OK button. Make sure it'll increase attack/defense levels. Pay special attention to Materia slots. The slots that are linked are effective. Also check the growth rates of Materia. Now when you want to remove an accessory... press the triangle button here. You should never remove weapons or armor. Because you never know when you'll be attacked. After you're finished equipping, you should re-equip your Materia. That's it!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "How to apply Materia?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Materia can unleash hidden power in humans. So let's see how Materia is used. First, access the menu. Then select [Materia]. Select who you want to use it. Pay close attention to my weapon here. Each weapon and armor has slots in them. Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. Now select the Materia you want to use. This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's only one thing you have to watch out for. When you equip Materia, your condition changes. Parts of you will become stronger... while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. The left side of the screen, shows the effect of the Materia. Try out everything. And that's all. I'll tell you about some of the finer points next.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Effective ways to use Materia?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Access the menu if you find Materia. There's a lot of different Materia around. This is one of them. It's [All] Materia. If you equip this alone, nothing will happen. It's a little tricky, but I'll tell you anyway. Now look at my weapon. Look closely at those two slots. They're joined together as linked slots. You've got to remember to put it into linked slots. Different Materia will affect each other. But only if the slots are linked. Just to show you, let's put some [All] into one of the slots, and [Lightning] in the other. Now we can use [Bolt] on [All] the enemies. But it's limited to once per battle. Combine different things and you'll come up with different results. Combining [Restore] and [All], will let you use [Cure] for your entire party. There are also many useless combinations. For example, [Restore] and [Lightning] [Bolt] and [Cure] can be used normally, but there won't be any compound effect. Specialized Materia like [All] is called [Support Materia]. You can tell the difference just by looking at the Materia's color. This may sound weird, but did you know Materia grows on its own? Even if one of your allies uses it, it will continue to grow with each battle. As its level increases, so will the effects of the magic you can use. I told you [All] works once per battle. But it can work twice or more as it grows. When you get it to the master level, Materia will divide itself, looking like it's giving birth. But that master Materia won't grow anymore. When you can't take Materia on anymore, you'd better sell it or dump it somewhere. You can see the useful functions here. You can [Arrange] Materia, [Remove all] Materia from your weapon. You can throw Materia into the [Trash]. Oops, relax! I wasn't gonna dump it. Let's see. This is a special menu for you. You can exchange all Materia you have between allies, even if they're not in your party. Now about Materia's growth. The growth rate depends on what weapon or armor it's put into. Some will double in growth, while others won't grow at all. In most cases, the Materia's effect won't change whether you put it into a weapon or armor. But [Elemental] and [Added Effect] are completely different depending on whether they're put into weapons or armor. You've got to think about what weapon or armor to use, or what Materia combinations will be the strongest. I remember hearing once... about extraordinary Materia somewhere in the world. I think I've told you just about everything I can.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "How to form your battle party?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: I'll explain your party's order in battle. First, access the menu and select [Order]. Next, select who you want to switch. Now, select the position you want. This will change their position in battle. In this case there isn't any advantage/disadvantage. But when you select the same person twice, it will place them in either the front/back row in a battle. When they're on the left side of the screen, that'll be the front row... When they're on the right, that'll be the back row. When you're in the front row and you select [Attack] you inflict major damage on your enemy. But you will also receive greater damage. While in the back row, although you do less damage to the enemy, you also receive less damage. For magic attacks, there's no difference in damage between the front &amp; back rows. There is also no difference when you use long range weapons. It's better to keep weaker members... in the back row. And that's it. Of course, I'm better off in the front row!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "How to check your status?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: You must know your current status. That's one of the basics of battle. Access the menu and select [Status]. Next, select the member you want to check. Were you surprised at the amount of information? I'll explain the order. First, these are your experience points and your level. The more experience you get in battle, the stronger you become. This gauge tells you how many points you need to get to the next level. If you can't beat stronger enemies, raise your level by fighting weaker ones. You'll improve your physical and magical skills. Next is HP and MP. HP is your life force. When it reaches zero, you won't be able to fight. MP is the source of your magic power. Every time you cast magic, you use MP. and when you run out of MP, you won't be able to cast spells. This is called the Limit gauge. It shows your anger level. When the gauge is full, you can use a "Limit Technique". I'll tell you about "Limit Techniques" later. You know the battle commands are classified roughly into two groups. [Attack] is for regular physical attacks. [Magic] and [Summon] cast magic attacks. Each has attacking power, defense power, and escape probabilities. The value depends on your equipment, and experience level. The total effect is on the chart below. These are commands you can use in battle. And your presently equipped weapons, armor, and accessories. Press the OK button here one more time. There are all types of attacks... Some monsters are weak against fire, others are weak against ice or lightning. The Materia or items you have can add these [Elemental]s to your attacks or protect yourself from them in an enemy attack. This chart shows your current attributes. Press the OK button here one more time. The chart below means [Added Effect]s. Some enemies will use sneaky attacks on you. These attacks change your condition, such as... sleep, confuse, poison, darkness, petrify, silence, small, frog, and so on. These conditions disappear after each battle, except fury and sadness which will remain. To cure these conditions quickly, use items or magic. There are specific medicines for each condition. I know I'm repeating myself but,... when you're taken out in battle, I mean, when you're almost dead, use [Life] magic or the item [Phoenix down]. When you change Materia or equipment it's best to look here to check on them. Mastering Elementals and Added Effects... will make your battles safer. That's all.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "About Limit status?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Here are a few hints on limit techniques. When an enemy has pushed your anger to the limits, you can unleash unimaginable power. You know what I mean, right? The trick is how to use it. Access the menu and select [Limit]. Now select a member. Now decide what your limit will be. Lower limits have less power, but you can use them more often. If you set your limit higher, you can inflict great damage, but you'll have to wait longer. After using this technique for awhile, you'll improve your technique. Your development will change depending on how you fight. I can't tell you how it will change. That's something you'll have to find out by yourself. I've heard a rumor about secret items that inspire ultimate techniques. I don't know whether or not those items really exist. That's it! Try everything out and use what's best for you!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Other things to watch for?".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: You probably know all this. But just in case, I'll go over it. Until you get instructions, don't open or take discs out of the PlayStation. After you open up the Disc Cover I can't guarantee what'll happen. That's all.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "That's all", conversation ends.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon obtaining the All Materia in the Beginner's Hall on the second floor of the weapon store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Hey!! You got one right off! That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the chest after obtaining the item from it.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Now listen, Hidden in these treasure chests, are a lot of items There are box types and bag types, so make sure you don't overlook any.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the woman in the Beginner's Hall by the save point.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: This is the fabled [Save Point]!! At a [Save Point] you can use a [tent] and/or select "SAVE". There's more, too. Look for something called secret. Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that same point. That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out. This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar... Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that. That should be all you need to know about the Save Point. I'll probably see you again somewhere on the road. Take care! I'm a [treasure chest]!! Beginners make sure and keep an eye out for me!!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the kids in the Beginner's Hall.)<br />
<b>NPCs</b>: ......smack......knock......!! Help!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You've got to hang in there. You're limit gauge is just starting to build.
</p><p><b>NPCs</b>: Waaaah!!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Ok! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight with your limit technique.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Great!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the kids again.)<br />
<b>NPCs</b>: Magic!! Magic!! Help!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic Barrier] or [reflect]. [Magic Barrier] reduces the damage received from magic by half. [reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times you can use it is limited so be careful.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Great!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the kids again.)<br />
<b>NPCs</b>:
</p>
<ul><li>Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too&#160;!</li>
<li>Me too!</li></ul>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: If you want to get as strong as me you need to use Materia. And you have to find the best combinations of them. The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will determine how quickly your Materia grows. Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The possible combinations are limitless. That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you have to have some natural talent.
</p><p><b>NPCs</b>:
</p>
<ul><li>I still don't get it!</li>
<li>I still don't get it!</li></ul>
<p><b>Cloud</b>: Listen kid, don't piss me off! That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll get used to it.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the bodybuilders in the Beginner's Hall.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Hey SOLDIER!! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But I'll rap with you for a while.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What do you want to know?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "About ATB".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: ATB or Active Time Battle is a system that is always in operation during battle. Select [Wait] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle. This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners. Selecting [Recommended] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle. This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you! Personally, I always use [Active], but you can use whichever you like.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "The numbers on the screen".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: White numbers appearing on the screen in battle are damage points. Green numbers show restorative points. You better watch these if you don't want to get wiped out.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "About [change] and [defend]".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: The [change] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows. In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less. You can make a [change] by pressing the Directional button in battle. Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses [defend]. Selecting [defend] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command. If you're up against a strong enemy, Don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "About [Escape]".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: I don't really remember ever having to use the [escape] command... but you'll probably need it. Push the L1 and R1 buttons at the same time, holding them down, and you can escape.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "About the gauges".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: During battle, there are several [gauges] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you. [time gauge] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle. When the gauge is full, you can make your command. If you don't want to make one, push the <img alt="Triangle" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-T.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-T.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/f/f7/Playstation-Button-T.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091254" class="lazyload" />button and you can move to the next character. It's convenient when you wanna make Barret work. The [limit gauge] increases every time you sustain damage. When it is full, you can use the [limit technique]. This gauge is not cleared after each battle, but gradually builds up over time. It takes a while for it to build up, so you have to think about which times are the best to use it. You probably don't know about it, but there are conditions of [status], [fury], and [sadness]. When you have [fury], your limit gauge builds up sooner, but your attacking accuracy is lower. Keep in mind that [sadness] makes your limit gauge build up slower, but the damage you receive is also lessened. [barrier gauge] is for specialized magic. The top gauge displays [barrier] or magic defense against attacks. The bottom gauge displays [magic barrier] or defenses against magic attacks. Both will cut the damage you receive in half. However, over time they will disappear. Whenever you use [barrier] or [magic barrier] make sure to pay attention to the [barrier gauge]. That's it. Remember that for the next battle.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "About [status]".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: [status] means just that. The status of each character. I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points. Sleep You cannot put in a command until you get up. Poison Steals your HP in battle. Fury Damage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it. Sadness Damage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it. Petrify Will petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out. Confuse Will attack enemy and ally alike. Silence Will be unable to cast magic. Paralyze Stops time gauges, commands. Darkness Accuracy of hitting attacks decreases. Frog Become a frog. I hate this one!<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Hoo...I'm beat. [status change], since this can be changed with magic and items, you should check it whenever you buy things.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "About [elementals]".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: [elemental] is the special effect that comes with certain weapons and magic. It's necessary to move ahead effectively. If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time. I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally. Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters. Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold. Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things. Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies. Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies. Gravity Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit. Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters. Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies. Holy Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge! Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true. To see what elementals an enemy has, you need [Sense] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "About [help]".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Looks like you didn't get it the last time I told you. What's wrong with you? You touched in the head? Well, don't worry. You just need to push the [SELECT] button in battle. Do that, and the [help message] will walk you through the commands. It also shows you the name of your enemy, so even I use it once in a while. Make good use of it.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "That's all the time I have for you!", conversation ends.)<br /></li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the lady in Johnny's home.)<br />

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "A village called Nibelheim".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Hm......you said Nibelheim? Wasn't it in the news a while back? Something to do with a Reactor accident... That was the first major Mako accident, so I remember it really being a hot topic.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Who cares?".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Ha, Ha!...... Well, there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say. But if you still have a family, You outta at least write them. Even though you may turn your back on your hometown, It'll always be there for you. Least that's how I see it.</li></ul>

One keycard alone won't let you go everywhere. For example, 'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. 'Keycard 65' only takes you to the 65th floor. It's a security system worthy of Shinra.

<p>(Upon talking to Choco Bill.)<br />
<b>Choco Bill</b>: Oh, what is that? What has this world come to? Stars falling and everything.
</p><p><b>Choco Bill</b>: With things the way they are now, how 'bout raising a Chocobo? No, I'm not trying to persuade you for money. It's just because of the state of things in the world. I thought that it would be a good and healthy thing for you to raise some Chocobos...
</p><p><b>Choco Bill</b>: Hmm...You just happen to be in luck! It just so happens that we aren't taking care of any Chocobos for anyone else, so... I could take care of 6 Chocobos right now, for 10000 gil per Chocobo. How 'bout it?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Take care of my Chocobos" with Cloud or Cid as party leader, "Could you take care of the chocobos?" with Tifa as leader.)
<ul><li>(If this is the first time asking Choco Bill to raise them.)<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: To raise a Chocobo, you'll need a 'Chocobo Stable'. And they rent for 10000 gil. Currently, I can rent out up to 6 'Chocobo Stables'. If you rent a 'Chocobo Stable', we will keep up to 4 of the Chocobos you catch in the fenced area outside. At a later date, you can select the Chocobo that you would like to put in your 'Chocobo Stable'.</li>
<li>(If there are stables available.)<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: 'Chocobo Stables' cost 10000 gil...
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Rent it" with enough gil.)<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: Thank you. My grandson takes care of the Chocobos. He's in the Chocobo Stable at the far right of the farm. Please tell him what you want.</li>

<li>(Upon selecting "Tell me something else" with Cloud as leader, "I'd like to hear about something else" with Tifa as leader, or "I wanna hear about something else" with Cid as leader.)<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: Someone once told me there is a 'Chocobo Sage'...somewhere.

<li>(Upon selecting "How do you raise them?" with Cloud as leader, "Tell me how you raise them" with Tifa as leader, or "How do ya raise 'em?" with Cid as leader.)<br /><b>Choco Bill</b>: Chocobos aren't hard to take care of. The day to day care will all be done here. But, please buy the food for the Chocobo, and feed them yourselves. Chocobo's abilities will differ with what you feed it, so feel free to choose your own food. Also, if you're able to find a male and a female Chocobo that like each other, they'll produce an egg. But only if you feed them a 'Nut'. New Chocobos inherit the abilities of their parents. I've heard that sometimes new breeds of Chocobo are born with special abilities. I've never actually seen it before, though.</li>

<p>(Upon talking to Chole if the player has not talked to the White Chocobo in Mideel or the Chocobo Sage.)<br />
<b>Chole</b>: Welcome! Hey, I've got something good to tell you. The white Chocobo likes it when you scratch behind its ears. But if you scratch it someplace that it doesn't like, it'll get mad, so be careful. 
</p><p>(Upon talking to Chole if the player has received advice from the Chocobo Sage, met the White Chocobo in Mideel, or heard Chole's advice.)<br />
<b>Chole</b>: Hey, do you know what a Chocobo Sage is?
</p><p><b>Chole</b>: What!? You've actually met him!? Wow! What did he tell you?
</p><p><b>Chole</b>: Wow, that's amazing! ...let me take some notes.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Chole after receiving new advice from the Chocobo Sage since first talking to her.)<br />
<b>Chole</b>: Hey, did you ever see the Chocobo Sage again? What did he tell you?
</p><p><b>Chole</b>: Wow, that's amazing! ...let me take some notes.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Chole in other instances.)<br />
<b>Chole</b>: What...?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Let me jot this down".)
<ul><li>(After receiving the first advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: Other than regular Chocobo, there are "Mountain Chocobo" and "River-Chocobo".</li>
<li>(After receiving the second advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: In order for the "Mountain Chocobo" and "River Chocobo" to be born, You feed the "Carob Nut" to a "Great Chocobo" or a "Good Chocobo" and have it produce an egg. But we don't sell any "Carob Nuts".</li>
<li>(After receiving the third advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: A "Great Chocobo" and a "Good Chocobo" are found... On an island Southeast of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling at Corel. And in the area west of Corel. The "Carob Nut" can be found south of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling. Monsters carry them. Let's see, is Bone Village just south of there?</li>
<li>(After receiving the fourth advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: One surprise If you get the "Mountain Chocobo" and the "River Chocobo" to produce an egg, You'll get a Chocobo that can cross mountains and rivers. I bet that the right nut for that is the "Carob Nut."</li>
<li>(After receiving the fifth advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: Bigger surprise: There seems to be a Chocobo that can cross the ocean. If you could cross the ocean, mountains, and rivers, there'd be no place you couldn't go.</li>
<li>(After receiving the sixth advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: In order to get an Ocean Chocobo you need to get a Mountain-and-river Chocobo to mate with something else.</li>
<li>(After receiving the seventh advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: If you mate the Mountain-and-river Chocobo with a "Wonderful Chocobo", You'll get an Ocean Chocobo. But to do that you can't use an ordinary Nut.</li>
<li>(After receiving the eighth advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: The "Nut" that produces Ocean Chocobos is the "Zeio Nut". This is the first I've ever heard of it. I wonder where you get them?</li>
<li>(After receiving the ninth advice from Chocob Sage.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: Zeio Nuts are found on a little island east of the Chocobo Sage. "Goblins" have them. With this, you can produce an "Ocean Chocobo". According to my research, Mountain, river, and ocean Chocobos are hard to produce. But, if you take the right care of the Chocobo, and increase their Class ranking by winning at the races, it'll increase your chances of getting one.</li></ul></li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Chole's Chocobo inspection".)
<ul><li>(If the player has no Chocobos in stables.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: There are no Chocobo.</li>

<li>(If the player has multiple, where XXXX is the name of the Chocobo she is referring to.)<br /><b>Chole</b>: For telling me that story, I'll tell you about each Chocobo's abilities.<br /><b>Chole</b>: From what I see, the fastest sprinter is... I think it's XXXX.<br /><b>Chole</b>: And, the fastest one is... That's XXXX<br /><b>Chole</b>: Also, from what I can tell, the one with the most stamina is... I think it's XXXX.<br /><b>Chole</b>: Finally, the most intelligent one is... That's XXXX</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Buy", open Vegetable Store.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Get some information", open submenu as below.)
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Feed?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: What the Chocobo eats are 'Greens' The most famous one is the 'Gizzard Greens.' Chocobos will mature differently depending on which 'Greens' they eat. Certain 'Greens' will boost their stamina. You'll have to figure out what kinds have what effects for yourselves. Oh, and Chocobos are born with certain natural abilities. So no matter how much they mature, they can't get more abilities than what they're born with. Remember that if a Chocobo's abilities don't increase even though you feed it, that means its limit is reached. It's best to let those kinds of Chocobo go or mate them to get a new Chocobo.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Mating?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: A male and a female Chocobo together can produce an egg.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Chocobo by the fence?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: The Chocobo out there is part of the stock that you caught. We can only keep 4 Chocobos here at once.

<li>(Upon selecting "Ride it outside?".)<br /><b>Choco Billy</b>: Yeah, you can ride this one. And even if you take it outside, this Chocobo won't run away when you get off of it. If you want to return it to your 'Chocobo Stable' just ride it onto the farm. Then, you'll be able to feed it again.</li>

<li><b>Tifa</b>: That's the reactor and the condor.</li></ul>
<p><b>NPC</b>: I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor. It seems the Shinra doesn't like the idea of having a condor on top of the reactor.
</p><p>(Depending on who else is in the party. Both party members make a comment, based on the order they are in the party.)<br />
</p>
<ul><li><b>Barret</b>: Damn, that's one big bird! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?</li>
<li><b>Aeris</b>: Why?</li>
<li><b>Tifa</b>: What's so wrong with having a condor on top of the reactor?</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b> (before "In the Land of the Study of Planet Life"): It's not very logical.</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b> (after "In the Land of the Study of Planet Life"): The logic eludes me.</li>

<li><b>Cait Sith</b>: Huh?......</li>
<li><b>Vincent</b>: ......That's too much.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Huh? I don't get it.</li></ul>
<p><b>NPC</b>: It seems there's some type of special materia in the reactor above us. And because the condors came, the Shinra rushed troops here. The military wants to get the condor and all the villagers off this mountain. The condors are now warming their eggs, which hatch only once every few years. We would like to protect the condors from being harmed.

<li><b>Tifa</b>: Condors' eggs. A real work of nature. We've got to protect the life of the planet.</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b> (before "In the Land of the Study of Planet Life"): So, to protect the eggs, are you gonna protect the reactor?......</li>
<li><b>Red XIII</b> (after "In the Land of the Study of Planet Life"): We're going to protect the reactor in order to save the eggs.</li>

<li><b>Cid</b>: You guys, what are ya gonna do?</li></ul>
<p><b>NPC</b>: Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves. That's why we have hired soldiers to help us. As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us... What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?

<b>NPC</b>: Whew, we'll be saved. Ask my son, who's standing guard at the shed, about the details of our military tactics. We're depending on you. Yes, yes, I've also told the store owners about you, so they should sell you various items. And feel free to use our beds.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Materia Store clerk after agreeing to help.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Hello. Do your best. We will, too.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Item Store clerk after agreeing to help.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: You hang in there!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man inside the shed at the top of the fort if Cloud talked to the man below and refused to help.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: So, will you help us? I don't want them to get killed. They're gigantic birds and so striking. We simply can't let them be killed by man's selfishness?
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Of course not. There's no way, especially at the hands of Shinra. If you're going to go look at them, get on top of that chair over there.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man inside the shed at the top of the fort after agreeing to help, if he has not yet explained the strategy.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Thanks for accepting. Let me explain our strategy. The enemy will climb the mountain looking for the reactor. We will leave a trap for them and hire soldiers to protect the area.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Well, that's all, but...... This village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke. If we hired one soldier, we would need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil. So if you folks have the time, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and command the troops. If you're pressed for time we'd like you to help us with the money. If you can give us the money, we can then hire soldiers with the funds and block Shinra's attack. We know that what we're asking is selfish. We have sent our wives and children to another village. We are resigned to our fate.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates our shed, you'll have to fight them immediately. Well, just because you lost once, it's not the end of the world, but if you lose repeatedly, it could be dangerous.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Conditions for victory".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: You can win by wiping out the enemy or killing the enemy commander in charge. If the enemy reaches the shed, they'll attack, and you'll have no choice but to go into battle immediately. In the event that you lose during direct contact, even if the enemy gets to the reactor, there's still a chance to save things. But it's only a slight chance, and we have no idea how much the reactor can endure in an attack. When we can't stand up to the attack any longer, the Shinra will take both the condors and our lives, as well as all the materia within the reactor.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "The enemy".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: There are four types of enemies.

</p><p><b>NPC</b>: ZZZZZ......
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier near the Respectable Inn ladder.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: This is a Respectable Inn... guests only!
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier on the left in the Respectable Inn.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off some stress.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You're right...
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Growth Materia".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: First off, the main points. Some types of Materia, like Magic, grow as you use them. Some, like Summon Magic, grow from being used once a battle, to several times per battle. Their effectiveness changes too. ...There are all different kinds. Some types don't change, but they must grow in order to be divided. ...And that's it. Maybe that sounded too official.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Kinds of Materia".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Types of Materia... Here goes...!<br />[Independent Materia] enables Abilities. No linking required.<br />[Support Materia] is used with Command, Magic, and Summon Materia. You must equip them in linked slots or they won't be any good.<br />[Command Materia] lets you use new commands. There are lots of different kinds of Materia, so you'll never get bored. One called [Attack] changes itself.<br />[Magic Materia] is easy. You can use Magic, and as your Level increases, you'll learn new Magic.<br />[Summon Materia] let's you use Summon Magic. As your Level increases, the number of times you can use it in a single battle increases. This's one of my favorites.<br />And there you have it, the five types of Materia.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Combinations of Materia".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: There's no single way to combine Materia. So here goes the basics. Support Materia... The basic combination is Magic + All. The variety of magic you can cast will increase as your Magic Level increases. When your All level increases, so does the number of times you can use it in a battle. That about covers it.<br /><b>NPC</b>: Huh? Wait a sec...<br /><b>Cloud</b>: You can change between Magic-All and Magic with the L1/R1 buttons. I'll bet you've probably already done this. One effective combination is Elemental + Summon Materia. If you equip this combination to your weapon, you can put Magic and Summon Elementals on your weapon. For example, if you equip Fire + Elemental to your sword, you will end up with Fire Elemental Sword. I'm getting off the subject,... If you equip Fire + Elemental to your armor, it will have twice the resistance to fire damage. Now this is important. When the Elemental levels in your armor increase, so will their effectiveness. From half damage - no damage - absorb. If you combined Elemental and Fire you could develop Fire absorbing armor.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Wait, there's more. Next is the Added Effect for Support Materia. The Added Effect Materia grafts the effects of Compound Status Materia into your weapons and armor. For example, equip Added Effect + Poison to your weapon and select [Attack]. Sometimes you'll give a Poison status. Of course, it doesn't always work. If you don't combine the Added Effect Materia with Status Change Materia, like Confusion or Time, you won't get any effect. To learn more about Added Effect, access the menu and check the Status. It's a little hard to get, but if you take your time, you'll be all right.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Divisions of Materia".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Division... I'm pretty good at this. People tell me that my personality is divided. But I don't think so, but maybe it is... Anyhow... Once your Materia reaches the maximum Level, it will divide. The original Materia will no longer grow. Once that happens, all you can do is use it as it is. New Materia always starts out with zero AP, so you need to raise its levels! Of course, once the new Materia reaches its max, it'll divide. That's how you increase your Materia collection. Ha, ha...... Right now I feel like I'm dividing myself.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Numbers of Materia that you may carry".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Once Materia starts dividing, you must be careful. There's a limit to how much Materia you can have. Since we're fighting for the life of the Planet, it goes against my beliefs carrying too much Materia. Either way, I don't really care, but...I'll leave it up to you. That's why, the amount of Materia that we can have is limited to 200... only what we can equip. When you have too much Materia, you need to dispose of some. If you don't, you can't take on any more. So, ditch some Materia before that happens... Ahem...I mean, give them back to the Planet.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "The rest is a secret", conversation ends.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the soldier on the right in the Respectable Inn.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Ok. Expert! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I don't have too much to say about that...
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Developing Limits".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: There are 2 basic ways of building up your Limit techniques. First, just use them! And second is to finish off as many enemies as possible! It sounds easier than it is. Everyone knows that when you gain a new Limit technique, you need to select it in the menu. And you knew that you won't be able to use advanced techniques on each level if you haven't used the basic ones. Since the type and growth for each limit techniques is different, that's about all I will say.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Extreme Limits".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: A long time ago I heard extreme techniques exist within the Limit techniques. But, if that's true you wouldn't be able to get it in any normal way. That's about all I know about it.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "That's it", conversation ends.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the ghost at the top of the Respectable Inn.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Ok, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER! Let me revenge...I mean, review!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What do you want to review?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "ATB".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: ATB means Active Time Battle. It's a system in which time continuously runs during battle. If the ATB is changed to [WAIT] in the Config Menu... Time stops during battle while you select magic or an item. That lets you select your commands carefully. It's geared especially for beginners like you. In config, if you change from ATB to [Recommended]... Time will stop while magic or item effects are displayed. This lets you watch the effects carefully. Letting you fight at your own pace... this is the way to go. I always use ACTIVE mode, but choose what you want. That's all.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Onscreen numbers".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: During a battle, white numbers that appear on the screen indicate damage, and green numbers indicate recovery points. Remember that, if you don't want to be wiped out.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Change and Defend".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Change will change your fighting position to either the front or back row. If you select the back row, the amount of damage you receive is reduced, but so is your attacking power. [Change] can be selected from the battle menu by pushing the [left Directional button]. You can also select [Defend] from battle menu by pushing the Directional button to the right. Defend will reduce your damage by half until your next turn. It's better to use Defend for strong enemies. Of course, I don't need anything like that.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Escape".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: I don't know too much about Escape during battles since I never do it, but...someone like you might need it. You can escape by holding down the <img alt="L1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-L1.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-L1.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/0/09/Playstation-Button-L1.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091345" class="lazyload" /> and <img alt="R1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-R1.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-R1.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/6/64/Playstation-Button-R1.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091509" class="lazyload" /> buttons during battle.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Gauges".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: It might be hard to understand this next one since you can't check it right now, but just listen. I'm talking about the Gauges displayed during battle. Time Gauge shows the time remaining until your next turn during battle. You can enter a command once the Gauge is full, but if you don't want to enter a command, press the <img alt="Triangle" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-T.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-T.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/f/f7/Playstation-Button-T.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091254" class="lazyload" /> button to skip to the next person. This is good when you want to make Barret work. The Limit Gauge increases as you receive damage. When this is full, you are able to use a Limit Technique. The Limit Gauge doesn't reset after each battle, so it will build up the more damage you get in battle. The trick is knowing when to use it instead of using it as soon as it becomes available. You may already know this, but I'll tell you anyways. Status has two conditions: Fury and Sadness. Fury speeds up your Limit Gauge, but decreases your concentration. Sadness slows down your Limit Gauge, but also decreases the damage you receive. Keep this in mind. Barrier Gauge shows the time available for special magic effects. The top gauge Barrier, defends against attacks. And the bottom gauge Magic Barrier, defends against magic spells. Both reduce the amount of damage by half, but disappear after several uses. Always keep an eye on the Barrier Gauge, when using Barrier and Magic Barrier spells. That's all. Check them out next time you're in a battle.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Status".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Status simply means the status of the characters. I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll mention the main points.<br />Sleep Cannot enter command until awakened.<br />Poison Rapidly decreases HP during battle.<br />Fury Doubles damage, reduces concentration. Tranquilizer cures it.<br />Sadness Damage reduced. Hyper cures it.<br />Petrify Turns you into stone. If entire party is petrified, You'll get Wiped Out.<br />Confusion You cannot distinguish between enemy and ally.<br />Silence You cannot cast any Magic.<br />Paralysis Time Gauge stops, you cannot enter commands.<br />Darkness Reduces attack concentration.<br />Frog Turns you into a frog. I hate this.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Phew...I'm tired. Changed Status can be changed with magic and items, so always double check it when you buy things.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Elementals".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Elementals are special Elementals that come with magic and weapons. You have to use this to your advantage in battle. Only once you start thinking in terms of Elementals can you truly be called an intermediate player. Here are some examples. Remember, they're just examples. You don't have to memorize them.<br />Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.<br />Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.<br />Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.<br />Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.<br />Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies.<br />Gravity Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit.<br />Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.<br />Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.<br />Holy Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Using opposite Elementals often is effective in battle. Using the same Elementals usually increases Defense. But, the reverse is also true. Watch out for it. To find out what Elementals an enemy has, you need Sense Materia. Once you get it, try it out.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Help".)<br /><b>Cloud</b>: If you don't understand what I just told you, I guess you just have a limited capacity for information. But, relax. Push the [SELECT] Button during battle. A Help Message should explain the different commands to you. It'll tell you things like the monsters' names, even I look at it, sometimes... So don't be ashamed to use it.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "That's all", conversation ends.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the ghost at the bottom of the Respectable Inn.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: This is the Beginner's Hall (Intermediate)! Your explanations were so complicated I couldn't return to the Planet. So, I have a right to ask you again.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What do you want to know?

</p><p>(Upon talking to the Shinra manager on the second floor in the Lower Junon Barracks.)<br />
<b>Shinra manager</b>: It's so shameful! ...and they told me that I would be staying at five star hotels on these trips...
</p><p>(Upon talking to him again.)<br />
<b>Shinra manager</b>: How can you guys sleep in a place like this?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Lower Junon Materia Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: There're lots of stores in Junon. If we don't do this...we can't compete. But, what bothers me is that the girls make more than me.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Lower Junon Item Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I used to be in SOLDIER... Once I left, I opened up this shop... But to tell you the truth, I'd rather be at the shop downstairs.

</p><p>(Upon talking to the Shinra Manager's Bar bartender.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I'm sorry. The bar is only for Shinra employees.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the sailor at the end of the Lower Junon Dock, after sending Rufus off.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Lately it seems like the economy's been better. Must be the 'Rufus' effect. Cargo ships are always coming and going from Costa del Sol. Now I'll overlook the fact that you're a stowaway, but you better at least help with the cargo.
</p>
<dl><dt>(After Meteor is summoned.)</dt></dl>
<p>(Upon talking to the soldier at the Airport Path in Upper Junon.)<br />
</p>
<ul><li>(While Tifa is party leader.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: It's kinda lonely at the airport without the Highwind, isn't it? I miss that bikini girl on the side of the plane.</li>
<li>(While Cid is party leader.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Right now the Shinra's using it to gather the Huge Materia from the Corel Reactor and from the Fort Condor Reactor. The Gelnika's flying all over the place! The only one that's not busy, is probably me!</li>
<li>(While Cloud is party leader, before finishing Junon Junon Huge Materia quest.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor! When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport. Get out of here before you get in the way!<br /><b>NPC</b>: What...me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either!</li>
<li>(After Junon Huge Materia quest, before Gelnika leaves the airport.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Finished loading the Huge Materia! All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done!</li>
<li>(After Gelnika leaves the airport, before Rocket Town Huge Materia quest.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: I'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely. But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor...</li>
<li>(After Rocket Town Huge Materia quest.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: The Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.<br /><b>NPC</b>:What...me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me.</li>
<li>(After Sister Ray is moved to Midgar.)
<ul><li>(First conversation.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: I finally got orders to join the Great Sephiroth Plan. I even get to go on the Gelnika too...<br /><b>NPC</b>: But, I'm just gonna ignore them. I wanna live to see the end of the world. If I'm lucky... There'll be a good place for me in the New World.</li>
<li>(Subsequent conversations.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Doesn't it bother you? Flying around knowing that you could die at any moment? If that's the case, might as well live on the edge, I say. But before I can do that, I gotta get a license first.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the soldiers in the Airport.)<br />
</p>
<ul><li>(While Tifa is party leader.)<br /><b>NPC 1</b>: I sure was frightened when Weapon attacked. It gives me the chills knowing there's still two of them left.<br /><b>NPC 2</b>: Oh yeah? Well, I'm ready to fight the worst enemy mankind's ever had like a real warrior. It's not everyday you get to fight in an inter-planetary war.</li>
<li>(While Cid is party leader.)<br /><b>NPC 1</b>: The President is gathering up all the Huge Materia on the planet. He wants to shoot it at Meteor in the rocket.<br /><b>NPC 2</b>: President Rufus is different from the older generation. He'll protect the planet with all of the technology Shinra currently has.<br /><b>NPC 1</b>: Protect? No, I don't think so. The President isn't the type to do anything so heroic. It's all just a game--a question of winning or losing--to him...</li>
<li>(After Cloud becomes leader, before Gelnika leaves the airport.)<br /><b>NPC 1</b>: After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!<br /><b>NPC 2</b>: They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.</li>
<li>(After Gelnika leaves the airport, before Rocket Town Huge Materia quest.)<br /><b>NPC 1</b>: Whew...I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete.<br /><b>NPC 2</b>: Not so fast. We still have one major task... we still have to transport the stuff...<br /><b>NPC 1</b>: The stuff...</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the man by the door on the street near the airport.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Come on in!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier at the Airport Path in Upper Junon during the Junon Huge Materia quest.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Our forces are in the process of gathering the Huge Materia from the Corel and the Fort Condor Reactors! Once these two missions are completed, the Underwater Reactor will be our next target! Till then, we do nothing but train, train, train!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier in the Upper Junon Barracks.)<br />
<b>NPC 1</b>: I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore. I've been had!! I want to get in a real battle, too!
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: Hey! Stop yappin'!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the soldier in the doorway to the Respectable Inn.)<br />
</p>
<ul><li>(While Tifa or Cid are party leader.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Hmmm? You have no right to enter!</li>
<li>(While Cloud is party leader.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all!? All right! You can enter!!</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the soldier in the left room of the Upper Junon Barracks' third floor.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon. Oh, of course, I was here, studying. And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach.
</p><p>(Upon talking to him again.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: After that, I'll get on the newspapers as a plain clothed First Class officer in SOLDIER... A triumphant return to my homeland!! Tons of fan letters... My future's peachy!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the sailor at the end of the Lower Junon Dock.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Everyday there's no ship coming in, I always come here to watch the sun go down. The sun disappears almost like it's swallowed up in the big horizon. And somewhere out there is a big unknown continent with another port city. Twilight always gets me misty... I'm so glad I became a seaman.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Well...I wouldn't have time for one now anyway because of that Weapon thing...
</p><p>(Upon talking to him again.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I haven't had a girl friend in 18 years. And I'm a romantic!......phew.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the clerk in the Upper Junon Item Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: They're not going to get me down! Not me!! Weapon, Meteor, even bad customers, aren't going to get me!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the clerk in the Upper Junon Weapon Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: This machine hasn't been working right ever since Weapon got to it!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the bartender in the Upper Junon alleyway bar.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I'd like to close down this shop, but we got the regulars to think about... I don't know what to do......
</p><p>(Upon talking to the large man in the table in the Upper Junon alleyway bar.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Weapon and Meteor scared everyone else off, but I'm sittin' here soused as usual.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the clerk in the Upper Junon Materia Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Welcome!! I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon really existed.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the clerk in the Lower Junon Weapon Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Weapon was really something. Nothing can compare with his strength, but with a selection like this, our weapons'll win.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Junon Inn innkeeper in Lower Junon.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Our rates are the same as the 1st class hotels. Would you like to stay?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "30 gil", party sleeps.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Forget it", nothing happens.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the soldier on the left on the first floor in the Lower Junon Barracks.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: All the real soldiers were killed fighting Weapon. It may seem ironic that losers like me are still alive. But that's the reality of it.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the solder on the right in the same room.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I'm learning to be a delinquent soldier!! I just can't seem to get the hang of it! It just isn't going right!!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Shinra manager on the second floor in the Lower Junon Barracks.)<br />
<b>Shinra manager</b>: I only came to help with the transporting of Junon's Huge Cannon, Sister Ray, but... Now the company tells me not to bother coming back... What's being a Shinra employee all about...?
</p><p>(Upon talking to him again.)<br />
<b>Shinra manager</b>: Yeeeeee...... If Weapon killed all the upper management... then I'll be President...!!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the girl in the Honey Bee costume in the Lower Junon Materia Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Look, why not forget about Meteor and Weapon for now and do a little impulse shopping!?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the grey-haired girl in the same store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Why don't you surround yourself with young girls and have some fun...maybe for the last time.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Lower Junon Materia Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I hired more girls after hearing that the world's coming to an end, but I wonder if I made a mistake. I keep getting more and more in debt. I've got to get out from under it somehow. Maybe I'll have Weapon help me.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Lower Junon Item Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I used to be in SOLDIER. Recently, I've felt like dressing up like this... I don't know why, it's out of season, but...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Shinra Member's Bar bartender.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I'm sorry. I've decided to close this place down. All my regular customers were killed by Weapon. Everyone was pretty weird, but I got a lot of memories of them.

The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best.<br />(Upon talking to him again.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Costa del Sol...a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round! Hmm......Things aren't going well...... You can go sightseeing in the city.</li>
<li>(After Rufus arrives.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.<br /><b>NPC</b>: Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys! Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship. That's tough for both of us.<br />(Upon talking to him again.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: The transport ship won't be sailing for a quite a while. Heidegger's orders.</li>

<ul><li>(Before Rufus arrives.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President. It seems like he's here on business this time. I'm so jealous of him, I could spit. We're both about the same age, but, he's President.</li>
<li>(After Rufus arrives.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Rufus complimented me on my job! Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the sailor on the Harbor helipad, seen before Rufus arrives.)<br />

<li>(After Rufus arrives.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: He's quite handsome, isn't he?...... Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond... He even looks good in a double-breasted suit.</li>

<li>(Upon selecting "Where're the stores?".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Show me around town".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook. It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.<br /><b>NPC</b>: Come on! I don't care about that! If you want a good time, come to the beach! There are lots of beautiful women. You wouldn't happen to be...rich?
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Oh yeah...".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking. But I'll tell you just in case. After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play!</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Well, not so".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: I thought so. Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.</li>
<li>(After the previous dialogue.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park. But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it. But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.</li></ul></li></ul>

Oh, sorry for going off like that...</li>
<li>(First time after defeating Ultima Weapon, learning Omnislash, and obtaining W-Summon Materia, with 10 GP.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong?

</p><p><b>NPC</b>: Oh, by the way, did you know? I heard that there's going to be a battle and only the strongest will be allowed to participate. But what do they mean by 'strongest'? If ya ask me I'll say it's 'weapons.' But, there's gotta be a way to measure this too. Mmm, we need another way to measure strength.

<li>(Upon selecting "Never mind", conversation ends.)</li></ul></li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Let me register" with no Chocobos in stables.)<br /><b>Ester</b>: Hmm, seems like there aren't any Chocobos that can be registered...</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Tell me how to ride it".)<br /><b>Ester</b>: Oh, you forgot? It's all right. Ahem!

In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own. But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen. You can't really help on this one. But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them. When you're riding, use the <img alt="Square" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation Button S.png" data-image-key="Playstation_Button_S.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/2/22/Playstation_Button_S.png/revision/latest?cb=20101022075233" class="lazyload" /> Button to Speed Up and the <img alt="X" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-X.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-X.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/3/3d/Playstation-Button-X.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091013" class="lazyload" /> Button to Slow Down. But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast. And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the <img alt="Circle" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation-Button-C.png" data-image-key="Playstation-Button-C.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/0/04/Playstation-Button-C.png/revision/latest?cb=20090519091158" class="lazyload" /> Button to get a boost of speed. Of course your stamina runs out faster though. There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast. For these kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down. Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line, Push the <span class="invert-dark"><img alt="Start" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="25" height="25" data-image-name="Playstation Button Start.png" data-image-key="Playstation_Button_Start.png" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/0/07/Playstation_Button_Start.png/revision/latest?cb=20101022071425" class="lazyload" /></span> button to end the race.</li>

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "The story of the Ancients...".)<br /><b>Elder Bugah</b>: You can't talk of the Ancients, without mentioning Professor Gast. He used to come here sometimes. He was a Shinra scholar who spent his life studying the Ancients. He was a serious person, never would have figured he'd be with the Shinra. Must've been about 30 years ago, when he found the corpse of an Ancient. He was elated! If I recall...he named it 'Jenova' and was doing a lot of research...<br /><b>Elder Bugah</b>: One day, he showed up here, looking real distressed. He was mumbling something about Jenova not being an Ancient and that he'd done a terrible thing... He's been missing since then. I heard that he never went back to Shinra<br /><b>Elder Bugah</b>: So, if you ever see Professor Gast, I want you to tell him... That the old man that likes to drink in Cosmo Canyon, wanted to hear about the Ancients. Well, there's lots to talk about, but most things about the Ancients are all legend and folk tales, and no one knows the truth.</li>

<li>(After defeating Hojo.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong...</li></ul>
<p>(Upon entering Cosmo Canyon after Hojo is defeated.)<br />
</p>
<ul><li>(If Red XIII is in the party.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from that last trip, he doesn't seem well. Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?</li>

</p><p>(Upon talking to the bartender in Pub "Starlet".)<br />

<ul><li>(Before defeating Hojo.)<br /><b>Elder Bugah</b>: Live with the planet, die with the planet. Maybe this is the way it should be. Who knows? I'm full of booze... It's when I think about the children. I wonder if we could just save our own children.</li>
<li>(After defeating Hojo.)<br /><b>Elder Bugah</b>: Where is the Promised Land...? Maybe Bugenhagen knows. Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon...</li></ul>

<ul><li>(If Red XIII is in the party.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: That Nanaki's slick! He said, 'I'll protect this canyon'! But he didn't. I don't care about Nanaki anymore...<br /><b>Red XIII</b>: Sorry...I'm really sorry. But now, I have......</li>

<ul><li>(If Red XIII is in the party, and the player has visited Bugenhagen for the final conversation.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Nanaki, is it true that Mr.Bugenhagen left on a journey?

Wasn't he with you?<br /><b>Tifa</b>: That's why we're here... Cloud... Cloud has...<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>:  I see... Cloud has......<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: It's true that there are several places on the planet where Lifestream is gathered. But most of those places are below the surface where humans cannot reach them. There's only one place An island floating in the Southern Sea...<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: What did you say? I haven't left here in years... No good. I can't remember.</li>
<li>(While Tifa is party leader, subsequent times.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: In the Southern Seas I think there was an island where Lifestream is. But even if you find Cloud there... Life's dream is a mass of spiritual energy, and one person alone probably couldn't stand against such an incredible spiritual current...</li>
<li>(While Cid is party leader, first time before finishing Huge Materia quests.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho Hoooo.<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>:...no time to be humming now. The planet is nearing imminent death. But is this perhaps, what the planet wanted? The planet actually wanted to end like this? I don't believe so. Were it not so, you people would still have much to do. And myself too. Come back whenever you are in need of my knowledge.</li>
<li>(While Cid is party leader, subsequent times before finishing Huge Materia quests.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Listening to you and Nanaki speak has made me feel young again. Ho Ho Hoooo. Might sound a little sarcastic.</li>
<li>(While Cid is party leader, after Huge Materia quests.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: You are using Shinra materia, as a weapon? Materia is highly dense spiritual energy. A shred of the planet's life. It should not be used as a weapon. We must stop using it... or the planet will become weakened.</li>
<li>(After defeating Hojo, if Red XIII is not in the party, and Bugenhagen has not given the Limited Moon.)<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>: Ho Ho.......Hoooo. You......? It's been a while...since I've been out. I think I must have...tired myself out a bit.<br /><b>Bugenhagen</b>:  Ahh......don't tell Nanaki. He'll only worry...</li></ul>

</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: ...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know. If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley. Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's. Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life. It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley...
</p><p><b>Bugenhagen</b>: What you will see will eventually become a part of life's dream. For my children...... And for your children...... So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes...your ears...
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: .........

Fortunately, none knew about the incident five years ago. Therefore, no one knows the town was restored exactly as it was five years ago. Our staff, disguised as townspeople have improved their acting skills, and we do not report any problems at this time. That is all.

<b>Tifa</b>: I have the sheet music for that song.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Huh? Wait a minute! There's something inside the music sheet.
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Tifa, what's happened to our town? Was it all an illusion, or just a dream? No, it was neither. I remember trying to get people out of the flames, but not having the strength... Burning with anger, I went to the reactor to kill Sephiroth.<br />But he was nowhere to be found. Instead, I found you, collapsed inside. I felt saving you was far more important than going after Sephiroth. There were several others that were still alive inside, but I was only able to save you.<br />As I was coming out of the reactor, Shinra troops were just arriving. I recall a scientist named Hojo was in charge. He ordered the troops to gather up everyone still alive for the experiment. I didn't know what type of experiment he was talking about, but I wasn't about to let them have my dearest student.<br />Putting you on my back, I headed down the mountain to the village. I used the Cure spell on you many times.<br />And started to head for Midgar to look for a doctor for you. I don't like that city, but my Cure spells weren't helping.<br />I decided to go to Midgar to find a doctor I could trust. I'm worried about you, but I can't settle down in one place for very long. Have you recovered fully? Are you well?<br />I wonder how many years have passed since then? I just got into town again, but I can't believe it... The whole town is back to normal, except for the strange beings with black clothes all around...<br />The town reeks of Shinra, but I won't go after them. You may think I'm running from them, but it's just that I don't want anything to do with Shinra anymore. Feels like time is running out.<br />I'm sure you'll find this letter. And this gift for you. It should come in handy. I can't even jump anymore. But I hope you continue to sharpen your skills and remember what I taught you.<br />To my most precious student, From Zangan

</p><p><b>NPC</b>: What? 'Me, in business'? Don't worry, it's all right. I get paid by the company. My real job is to protect the secret of Nibelheim.
</p><p><b>NPC</b>: What? Secret? We don't have a clue. But it's all right. It's all over anyway! The end, the end, the end!! Yeah, even as we speak, Meteor...! The End...!

</p>
<ul><li>(While Tifa or Cid are party leaders.)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Would you like a drink?

<p>(Upon talking to the woman walking on the right side of the town.)
</p>
<ul><li>(Before or during "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Life is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it. Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.</li>
<li>(After "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li>(Before "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Alright, alright, alright! I know! On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao! I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!</li>

<p>(Upon talking to the man in front of the pagoda.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods... The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything. Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God. Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods. But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man in the old man's house before finding Yuffie in there during "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br />
<b>NPC 1</b>: Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see...what was your name?
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: No, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Weapon Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Hey yo! Welcome! Strike while the iron's hot, I say! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the other man in the Weapon Store if he was spoken to during "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Listen, I'm sorry about last time. Yuffie told me not to sell anything to you.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Turtle's Paradise bartender.)
</p>
<ul><li>(If Yuffie has not locked the party in a cage during "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Hey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home. Nowadays, thanks to tourism, Wutai's able to get by.</li>
<li>(After Yuffie locked the party in a cage during "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br /><b>NPC</b>: Seems like the town got really boisterous since you arrived. Did anything happen?</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to the customer in Turtle's Paradise.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai. They say the Water God was a huge snake! Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now. But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe. Believe in the scales of the Water God and in materia that has its power in it.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Item Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the other woman in the Item Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: I'm sorry. The sign outside says "Materia", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai. Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides... If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't...
</p>
<dl><dt>(After Meteor is summoned.)</dt></dl>
<p>(Upon talking to the woman walking on the right side of the town.)
<b>NPC</b>: Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether that planet falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the child near the save point.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are going to be dust! Can't we do something?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man on the path to the pagoda.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: The end is right in front of us... But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life day in and day out...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man in front of the pagoda.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Have you ever heard the story of the scales of the Water God? They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden powers. And are impervious to the strongest flames. But of course I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that huge eerie-lookin' Planet's gonna make when it crashes into us...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the man in the old man's house before finding Yuffie in there during "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br />
<b>NPC 1</b>: Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even see the moon in afternoon. Everyone's celebrating.
</p><p><b>NPC 2</b>: No, Gramps! That's a big red planet in the sky! Everyone's scared of it!!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Weapon Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Hey yo! Welcome! You aren't tired of my babbling? Great! Then come on in and start buying!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the other man in the Weapon Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: This is a weapons store of the hard cores, by the hard cores, and for the hard cores! Come on and take a look, why doncha!?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Turtle's Paradise bartender.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: First the ground started shaking, then that large star...... Yy, you think... It's all over?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the customer in Turtle's Paradise.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Hey. Things look pretty sad around here. With things the way they are in the world I guess there's nothing I can do about it. Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all might as well sit back and have a beer...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Item Store clerk.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this? You're an odd one...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the other woman in the Item Store.)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: And now it's too late to be worrying about materia at this stage of the game... If you see anything you need, buy it.
</p><p>(Upon talking to people in the room with a statue in the house to the right of the pagoda, after "Homecoming of a Miserable Daughter".)<br />
<b>NPC</b>: Help me. Help me. Help me...... He's in the pagoda next to Lord Godo. Lord Godo says we're stuck... num, num...... I hope the planet doesn't fall anywhere around here......

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Yes".)
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "The Original Crisis".)<br /><b>Gast</b>: Camera's ready!<br /><b>Gast</b>: Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra.<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: 2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet. The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at the Knowlespole.<br /><b>Gast</b>: Tell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a Planet-reading.<br /><b>Gast</b>: Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: ...I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a conversation with the Planet... It said something fell from the sky making a large wound. Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet... But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal itself, over many years.<br /><b>Gast</b>: Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal the Planet?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living things on this Planet becomes the energy. The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to diminish the needed energy...<br /><b>Gast</b>: Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts. Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its injury?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away the land...then the Planet... The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, but...<br /><b>Gast</b>: Ifalna... Let's take a break.<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: I'm all right... When the Cetra...were preparing to part with the land they loved...<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: That's when it appeared! It looked like...our...our dead mothers ...and our dead brothers. Showing us spectres of their past.<br /><b>Gast</b>: Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I have't any idea.<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: That's when the one who injured the Planet... or the 'crisis from the sky', as we call him, came. He first approached as a friend, deceived them, and finally...... gave them the virus. The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad... transforming into monsters. Then, just as he had at the Knowlespole. He approached other Cetra clans...... infecting them with... the virus...<br /><b>Gast</b>: You don't look well... Let's call it a day.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting 'What is "Weapon?"')<br /><b>Gast</b>: Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Yes, Professor. The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra... was named Jenova. That is the 'crisis from the sky'. The Planet knew it had to destroy the 'crisis from the sky'... You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able to fully heal itself.<br /><b>Gast</b>: Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of it's own will?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Yes, but... There is no record of Weapon ever being used. A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it. The Planet produced Weapon... But it was no longer necessary to use it.<br /><b>Gast</b>: So, Weapon no longer exists on this Planet?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Weapon cannot vanish. ...it remains asleep somewhere on the Planet. Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at some time... The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still, watching Jenova.<br /><b>Gast</b>: Where is Weapon?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: I don't know...... I can't hear the voice of the Planet well... Times...have changed. The Planet...is probably watching this situation closely.<br /><b>Gast</b>: ...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today...</li>

But, the video's not working right...<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't mentioned?<br /><b>Gast</b>: No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: And when she's sleeping, her face ...looks like an angel.<br /><b>Gast</b>: First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video later!<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aeris. That's that!<br /><b>Gast</b>: You are SO selfish! But Aeris is a good name!<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Hee hee...it's a good name, considering it came out of that forgetful head of yours!<br /><b>Gast</b>: <br /><b>Gast</b>: Right!? Oh, the video tape......</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Daughter's Record: 20th Day after birth".)<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Video again? You just got through taping!<br /><b>Gast</b>: ......... Please don't say it that way. It's our lovely daughter, both yours...and mine! Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be strong... Aeris is different from the other children. I wonder what dangers await her...?<br /><b>Gast</b>: Never say that! I will protect you and Aeris no matter what!! You and Aeris are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: I feel so much better now, darling. If I hadn't met you, I......<br /><b>Gast</b>: Who could that--I was just about to...<br /><b>Gast</b>: Damn!! How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: I'll send them away. Yes, at once!! Who the devil?<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: It, it's them!!<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Heh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or should I say, Cetra!<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Long time no see, Professor Gast!<br /><b>Gast</b>: Hojo... How did you know?<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you. Two years I waited... That's how much I wanted this new sample......Ha, ha, ha.<br /><b>Gast</b>: ...New sample? You don't mean Aeris!?<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Hmm, Aeris? What a nice name......Ha, ha, ha.<br /><b>Gast</b>: That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra. Hojo, please leave.<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Please, Aeris has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, right?<br /><b>Gast</b>: Ifalna!<br /><b>Hojo</b>: I'll need all of you for my experiment. You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet!<br /><b>Gast</b>: Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my precious sample.<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha ......<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Wh...what are you doing, Professor!?<br /><b>Gast</b>: Ifalna! Take Aeris and run!!<br /><b>Ifalna</b>: Eyaaaaaah... Darling......!!<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Oh, and uh... don't forget the child!<br /><b>Hojo</b>: Hmm, a video? The Ancients...Weapon!? Heh, heh, heh...a mountain of treasure!
